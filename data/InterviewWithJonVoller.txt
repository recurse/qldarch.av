INTERVIEW WITH JON VOLLER
24 SEPTEMBER, 2012

JV 
00:00:01	How many people are you interviewing?
JG
00:00:06	Well, right now we've done about 12, but I think we're going to go for more.
JV	
00:00:13	You can do 50 and, I mean, we're not going to have enough resources.   One thing before we start, you know BVN's got some tapes of Arthur Bligh and Col Jessup?
JG
00:00:29	We have those.  The interviews, they were done in '96, something like that.
RR
00:00:35	Maybe, probably around then.  They were done by historian Bruce Buchanan's wife, Robyn.  Robyn Buchanan.
JG
00:00:46	Yeah, we have the transcriptions of those interviews, we obtained those
JV
00:00:51	Arthur would have been interesting I think because was, maybe a bit verbose, but he knew what was going on around '45 certainly, when he got into practice just after the war.  Again, he started the practice before then of course.  So, I'm glad you got those tapes because I organised them, before those guys fell of their perches.
JG
00:01:31	Today is the 24th of September 2012.  Rob Riddel and I and Michael Sayer are interviewing Jon Voller at UQ Customs House.
RR
00:01:50	Well, I suppose we should start by looking at the standard questions, your architectural qualifications and where you studied.
JV
00:02:04	I studied at University of Queensland.  I have a Bachelor of Architecture.
RR
00:02:09	And that was 1962 you started.
JV
00:02:12	I started there yes.
RR
00:02:14	And you went right through?
JV
00:02:15	Yep.
RR
00:02:17	And, did they have a year off in those days?
JV
00:02:20	No, we had three years full time and three at night.  So, I started work in my fourth year.  Which, I think, was not a bad thing to do actually.  You ended up graduating with a lot of real knowledge as well as theoretical knowledge and some of the students that I've employed since that time haven't filled that bill.  But, I must say we've had some very good students in our office in the last two years that - actually from UQ and QUT who amazingly - what's the word - they don't have a lot of knowledge but they're thirsty for it and they listen and they think, rather than sitting there doing exactly what you tell them to do.
RR
00:03:25	Well, you've got to want to know and that's, you know, if you've got students who don't want to know then, you've got a problem.
JV
00:03:32	Yeah, that's right.  They're just a drafty, don't contribute.
JG
00:03:37	What were the teachers like then, at UQ?
JV
00:03:39	There were three different professors during my time, the one going out after a long career was Robert Cummings, who's well known.  He was a likeable chap and he convinced me after first year to stay studying architecture.  I wanted to skip off because I hated the physics and the maths that we had to do in those days.  Following him was Gareth Roberts who had quite a significant influence, I think, on me, and introducing me to have an interest in urban design and I was going to go and study urban design after the course, after talking with him about that.  He went on to be the boss of the NCDC, I think, National Capital Design Commission.  
00:04:36	Interesting chap, I think he was English, he was certainly from the UK, but I don't know what - - -
RR
00:04:43	And he was a town planner.
JV
00:04:44	He was, yeah.  And, then I finished the course under Bal Saini who was, you know, compared with the other two a laconic laid back 'why don't you come home and have a party with us' sort of bloke, you know, he was a pretty good guy and I remained friends with him for a long while.  
RR
00:05:11	What about the course, what did you think?
JV
00:05:16	The course was okay.  First year was possibly the most exciting.  We were the first year to study under a chap from Melbourne called Bill Carr, who was quite avant garde man, in those days, and set about destroying any preconceptions of design that we might have brought with us into the first year and remoulding them.
RR
00:05:44	Was that good.
JV
00:05:45	Yeah, I think it was.  Yeah, he was an unusual person and it was good and to see him in contrast with some of the various straight up and down Scotsman like Bill Gregg and Hamish Murison  were a bit weird, but, delightful. And, even Stan  Marquis-Kyle, but Stan Marquis-Kyle was a beaut bloke too.  A technical type chap, but when it came to design and drafting; whereas if you could convince Bill that you could draw better in your own blood he'd be happy about that, you know.
RR
00:06:39	So, did that cause ructions and conflict?
JV
00:06:45	I'm sure it did amongst the academics.  I would have thought that there were some ructions and I can't remember them but, you know, he was so different that it must have been problematic and I'm sure that someone like Stan Marquis-Kyle would have stilled the waters on a regular basis.  Although he was an old fashioned bloke, Cummings, the professor, he was  free thinking guy too you know, he could think the big picture; I mean he's the one who would have employed Bill Carr anyway. 
RR
00:07:45	And, Bruce Lucas would have been there?
JV
00:07:47	Bruce taught us Professional Practice. The feeling of lack of tuition in that area was no one ever told you how to run a business.   And, when you go into practice you've got to run a business and if you don't, you don't survive very well.  So, I don't know whether the courses have changed.  From talking to students I don't think they have, particularly.
MS
00:08:20	No, but I think no one really has those skills to impart, that's the trouble.
JV
00:08:26	Other people do, not architects, but anyway it was fun learning.  The other interesting bloke we had who came to us in third year, was our design master, was Graham de Gruchy and he remained a friend for a long while too and he was - Ian Sinnamon too who came to the school while I was there.  I'd know Ian when I was a ten year old because he'd done his time with my old man.  I think he might have even been - not apprentice - but, the word you could study architecture by working under - - -
MS
00:09:20	They used to call that articles in Europe, but I'm not sure about here.
JV
00:09:24	I'm not sure that you couldn't do it that way here as well, in those days.  They're the people that stand out in my memory, from the course.
RR
00:09:39	Were you taught history?
JV
00:09:41	Yeah.  I don't know who taught us that, might have been - not it wasn't Athol, he was down at the QUT.
MS
00:09:51	Well, we used to finish with the Renaissance.  There was nothing after that.  We started with the Pyramids and finished with the Renaissance.
JV
00:10:01	I don't know whether it was Bill Carr or not, but I wasn't interested in history as a school boy.  I'm still - history's not that critical to me.  Bill made me into a modernist, I don't know.  But, I've always been more interested in what's happening now.  It's the same in art.  I have no great desire to look at contemporary art, very modern art, not that much interested in going to see the Masters.
RR
00:10:41	What about modern architecture, I mean, there were people telling you about Frank Lloyd Wright, or?
JV
00:10:46	Yes there were.  Maybe that was, maybe Bruce Lucas lectured in that area too and the prof probably.
RR
00:10:58	But, it wasn't a big part of your experience of being there.  I mean you were learning other things.
JV
00:11:03	Yeah.
MS
00:11:05	I mean there seemed to me that there was an emphasis on being original and having something that hadn't been done before.  Was that your feeling or not?
JV
00:11:20	Yeah probably, I think so.  I'd agree with that.
RR
00:11:24	I mean, the people who had ideas became the best students. That's always the case but, it was - - -
JV
00:11:37	Certainly we were forced to have our own ideas you're right.
RR
00:11:43	But attribution of other people's ideas was not something that was really encouraged.  We used to look at magazines a lot - to help us to design projects - I mean, I can remember a few instances where there was a project like Sea Ranch on the west coast of the US and that got passed around among the students and saying, 'this is where it's at' and you know, the course wasn't doing that the course was doing something, for me - but it wasn't your UQ course I'm talking about QIT.
JV
00:12:29	I think, you know, de Gruchy would have encouraged us to think modern and look contemporary rather than look behind.  And, he also encouraged us to think outside the box, think original, solve your own problems, don't seek solutions - pat solutions if you like - from other places. 
00:12:59	Some of the tutors we had stirred us along in a big way.  Memorable evenings of Jim Birrell carving us up in our tutorials, more convivial if you like, and less evasive I guess, in manner was Maurice Hurst, the design tutor, he was - I had a lot of respect for Maurice and I liked the design work that he did as well.
MS
00:13:54	Yeah, it think everyone thought that, but at least they were the people that were out there doing the work and it's good that they were brought into the course as well.
JV
00:14:10	It was.  Yep.
JG
00:14:11	But did they show their own work as well?
JV
00:14:15	No, they came and criticised yours and contributed, you know, and why didn't you think of this sort of thing.  Still the same technique you'd use today in an office and have a pin up to discuss a design before you harden up your thoughts and go and present it to the client.  It was a fine process.
JG
00:14:39	But, was there a sort of atmosphere amongst the students that you would go and see modern architecture that was being built, because, around St Lucia things were cropping up at great speed?  Was there an atmosphere that you would go and see a project at your own initiative?
JV
00:14:56	Probably.  I don't remember, it's a long while ago.
RR
00:15:02	I mean, the Gold Coast for me, represented at lot of things I was interested in.  You know, there was modern architecture there in a way that you probably couldn't see in the same concentration in Brisbane.  So, you know, you were aware of the Broadbeach Hotel and you were aware of beach houses and the Chevron Hotel came along and, you know, you thought, 'There's no end to this, this is where I want to be.' 
JV
00:15:29	 I must say, Karl Langer is one of my heroes in the local scene here in the period that you're looking at and certainly the Lennon's Hotel at Broadbeach was probably his biggest work.  His house was up the road from where I grew up in St Lucia.
RR
00:15:54	What do people think of that?
JV
00:15:56	They didn't like it at all.
RR
00:15:59	Was that anything to do with him being perceived to be German?
JV
00:16:02	No, I don't think - well, I don't know, certainly that never appeared on my personal radar you know.
RR
00:16:11	Well, he was part of the course as well.
JV
00:16:12	Yes, that's right, he was.
RR
00:16:13	And, yet for what his abilities were he didn't seem to ever succeed in practice in the way that you would have thought that he might have.
JV
00:16:27	That might have been some ethnic cringe by people at that time, you could be right.  I  actually never thought of that before this moment.  But, you could be right, because he was a very bright man.  I think, was Michael Bryce working with him for a while?
RR
00:16:47	That I don't know.
JV
00:16:48	No, I don't know either.   I reckon I learnt more in the first few years out of the course than I did during the course anyway.  So, the course was something you did and needed to finish, any students that I find sort of fiddling around and taking years to finish their course, I encourage them to get back there and finish and then go and do whatever they want to do.
JG
00:17:38	During the last three years you said you studied in the evenings and then you worked at a firm here?  Which one?
JV
00:17:44	I'd had a job, a holiday job, with Hayes & Scott.  When it came to work full time they didn't have a job, so I ended up working with one of those Gold Coast architects, Douglas and Barns, who had an office in Brisbane and in Surfers Paradise and were doing quite interesting work, actually, and technically unusual.  They started using reinforced concrete block work, for example, in the early sixties.  Single skin block.
RR
00:18:29	They did that amazing church in Indooroopilly or is it Taringa.
JV
00:18:34	On the border line there somewhere.
RR
00:18:35	But there was nothing like that in the rest of Brisbane anyway.  So, where did that come from?
JV
00:18:44	I don't know.  They were very much into concrete and one of the first times I can remember holidaying with mutual families with you, we were staying in their beach house at Mermaid I think it was, which was an interesting little concrete block, flat roofed apartment.
RR
00:19:08	I'm not aware of it.  I can remember a little house they did in Nobby's that was quite close to the Kennedy's is that one?
JV
00:19:15	Yeah it was near - maybe t was Nobbys, yeah.
RR
00:19:18	It wasn't right on the beach it was just one back.
JV
00:19:20	It was one door back in a street that ran into the beach.
RR
00:19:23	Yeah, I remember that house, yes.
JG
00:19:26	Do you remember any of the projects that you worked on while you were there?
JV
00:19:31	A few, yeah, none of them significant.  Small block of apartments at Currumbin on the hill there, that was structurally an interesting building because of the structural block work.  That was one of the first jobs that Bornhorst & Ward - Brian Ward - did, when he started up practice here in Brisbane and became the avant garde structural engineer of the town.  So, that was an interesting process as well, for me as a student, to be working with a structural engineer that thought outside of the box and was doing things differently to what was considered the norm, you know.
RR
00:20:30	And, after Douglas and Barnes, did you?
JV
00:20:32	Yes, I worked with Curro Nutter & Charlton.
RR
00:20:35	All the good ones.
JV
00:20:37	No, I'd wanted to get a job there for quite a while and I worked  quite closely with Danny Nutter and enjoyed that.  I met Noel Robinson there, he was a student there as well at the time, two or three years behind me.  Was he in your year?
RR
00:20:54	He was.
JV
00:20:55	So, two years behind me.  I've been friends with Noel since.
JG
00:21:02	Which other significant contemporaries have you studied with do you remember?
JV
00:21:11	Well, the only ones I really remember, those that were friends,  and I'm not sure that they're significant.
JG
00:21:19	Significant to you.
JV
00:21:23	To me just as friends, not architects, Roger O'Sullivan, Lou Young, but it's interesting I think that in our first year there were three of us who were the same age and we'd all been to school together and here we were in first year architecture together and we were all sons of architects.  That's Bruce Goodsir, Bruce Carlyle and myself and Stan Marquis-Kyle used to refer to us as the firm, first year.  Bruce Goodsir  went on to be a significant educator and designer and artist.  I've lost touch with him now, he's been in Tasmania for 30 years.  Bruce Carlyle went on and worked with Robin Gibson for a long while and then I think decided to go and make some money, so he went and worked in construction and became senior man in Watkins then ended up as the senior bloke in John Holland on the construction side.  I think he was construction manager there.  I'm still good friends with Bruce Carlyle.
JG
00:23:03	A question that we forgot to ask you at the very beginning, what made you decide to study architecture?  Was it because of your father?
JV
00:23:14	Look, there must have been a subconscious interest there.  I wanted to go to university because I was putting off going to work as long as I could I guess and architecture seemed like a good option.  I mentioned earlier that I did try to get out of it at the end of first year, by the time I was working I'd realised I was doing the right thing and I've had so much fun, and as an architect, in my whole life then I know I did the right thing, it was meant to happen.  
00:24:01	And, I've had so much fun in practice that's why I didn't ever go on to do any post grad work.  I should have gone and done a Masters of Urban Design or something like that, in fact, that's what I wanted to do as I said earlier, under the influence of Garth Roberts, go to Edinburgh and study there, but it didn't happen, because I was busy.  I've been around the world, worked in a lot of different places, so, had a lot of fun.  And, my 40 plus years of practice have just gone, you know, just like that.  Hasn't been a task or a hard thing, it's been easy.
JG
00:24:49	So, you've also worked abroad?
JV
00:24:52	Yeah.
JG
00:24:53	Where did you?
JV
00:24:55	I went to Canada and I think I learnt more about design from the guy I worked for there in 18 months than I did at unit.  Very small office, a highly recognised practitioner in Calgary in Western Canada, Gordon Atkins.
JG
00:25:18	That was right after university that you went there?
JV
00:25:22	A year later.
RR
00:25:24	So, that first year after university was with Curro Nutter?
JV
00:25:29	No, I was working with Bligh Jessup Bretnall before I went away, where my old man was.  They wouldn't employ me until I'd graduated, so I had a year there before I went away.
RR
00:25:46	So, I was there in '69 and you were?
JV
00:25:51	Yeah, I went away very early in '69 I left.
RR
00:25:55	Right. And, you went to Canada and then?
JV
00:25:57	And then South Africa.  I worked there for a couple of years and then one day I got a phone call from Bligh Jessup Bretnall, we'd like you to come home, so about a month later I was back in Brisbane and there I sat for 30 plus year.
RR
00:26:21	Was it the right move?
JV
00:26:23	Yeah.  Course it was.
JG
00:26:25	So, when did you start at Bligh Jessup and Bretnall?
JV
00:26:28	Sixty-eight.  After graduation I - or after I'd finished the course, I actually didn't get my degree deferred because of fiddling around with a thesis until the end of '68, so I was working there in '68.  I hadn't realised then what an influence on my life Graham Bligh would be but he was the new design director, if you like, in the firm when I arrived there.  I certainly wasn't doing any design work, I was busy drawing, you know, working drawings and things for projects at that time.
RR
00:27:27	I was certainly given a lot of freedom there and probably, I mean, when I think about it now, extraordinary the things you were given to, maybe they never turned into anything that got built, but as a starting point and I guess Graham was the person that was making those decisions.
00:27:56	But, Don McNiven was the person I worked closely with there and he certainly had a lot of ability and he was - - -
JV
00:28:05	I was instrumental in getting Don to join that firm, because I'd worked with him when I - another firm I've worked with as a student - Frank Cullen or Cullen Hargreaves and Mooney as they were called.  Don was there and I worked under him and wanted to be like him.  You know, I wanted to be an erudite, someone who'd been all over the world.  You know, high quality architectural designer by the time I was 30, which is what Don was.
RR
00:28:40	Do you know what happened to him?
JV
00:28:41	No, I don't.  I last him in London in '74, haven't seen him since.
RR
00:28:47	Yeah, I've lost touch with him too.  He was in London then.
JV
00:28:55	That, Cullen's office was an interesting influence on me too, probably not from a design point of view, except for Don and David Kenny there.  But, they were bloody good technicians, their buildings were technically very good and they had some - one in particular - actually, Bligh Jessup did too - the old clerk of works who I was working under on site supervision at Cullen's, as a student, you know and that's just a brilliant way to learn about contract law and how to deal with builders and things.
RR
00:29:41	What about South Africa, was there anything of significance there?
JG
00:29:44	How did you get there?
JV
00:29:48	Through a mate who sent me a spurious telegram as a joke, which I received on the same day as I was given three months notice in Canada, saying, "Holding job open, how quickly can you get here."  Anyway, I got married while I was studying - at the end of fifth year - and we both wanted to - you know, cut the strings with our parents and get away and our first preference was Canada, our second preference was South Africa.  We weren't ready to go to Europe and they were - certainly North America was a brave new world - a far as I was concerned, we were having a bit of trouble getting into Canada, but I eventually did and I enjoyed that.
00:30:49	And, why did I go to South Africa?  Because it was our second choice and the opportunity arose - our mates who are Steve Burns and Libby Ord, both architects, were working there and they'd just said, look you turn up and you'll get a job, and I did.  I was offered a job the day I arrived there, even though I was in my hippy period of sandals, jeans and beads and colourful shirts.
RR
00:31:19	I remember that.  
MS
00:31:21	You didn't go to Capetown, you went - - -
JV
00:31:23	No, no, we were in Durban, which was a magic city in those days, I hear it's horrible now, but, just a big city with the main street ending on a fantastic surf beach.	
JG
00:31:38	What type of projects did you work on there?
JV
00:31:40	Big projects.  Hotels, shopping centres, with a firm that was a couple of Jewish partners and an English guy, it was a good practice.  Again, I learnt a lot under clerk of work type people on contract law, I had a great time actually and my wife had a stunning job there and - with the university - and, we both enjoyed it very much. We couldn't stay because we couldn't abide the apartheid regime, it was pretty strong, even though I think it probably led to a more ordered life than now, where the apartheid used to be practiced by some blacks on other blacks, which was unfair, anyway.   I don't want to go back.  It was a wonderful memory, that's it.  
RR
00:32:50	So, when you got back to Bligh Jessup, then what?  And, what year is this?
JV
00:32:57	I came back here in the middle of '72 and started working closely with Graham Bligh, he was - why I was asked to come back was because that practiced received - on the same day - the commission for two 30 storey office buildings. Arthur Bligh wanted to bring people into the firm to work on these projects that would be the firm's future.  I looked after MLC Tower, and Graham was looking after Watkins Place in Edward Street.
RR
00:33:46	So, this is the - not the MLC that I remember in Edward, this is the new one along George?
JV
00:33:52	Yeah, which is now Hitachi or some or some other name.  That's right.  We were dictated to in design, by a design and construct firm - Civil and Civic - but it still was an exciting job to work on.  With part of the deal of my coming back was that I'd have an opportunity to step up to being a partner.  I had to remind them of that a bit and that happened in '74 and became an associate, which was a half shareholder and then when Arthur Bligh and Col Jessup retired in '75, I became a full equal partner in the firm then and enjoyed 30 years almost, with a wonderful and very close relationship with Graham. We made the running in the firm for most of that time and my relationship with Graham is still very close - although we don't see each other a lot - and in reflection I think a lot of things between us were unspoken, but we knew the way - we understood how each other thought and what each other's strengths were and where to lean on them.  I've very lucky in my career to have that relationship with that person.
JG
00:35:40	And, were there other people at the firm that you particularly got along with well, work wise?
JV
00:35:46	I get along with everyone I think, I'm that sort of bloke, but, no, no one like him. I had some other relationships that the end result of them disappointed me and I won't go into those, but, people who were partners in the firm and chose to leave, which disappointed me, but that's fine, that's life.	
RR
00:36:17	But, I mean, you had to make some pretty tough decisions along the way and following the early '90s when you decided that - on a pretty radical move.
JV
00:36:31	That was the late '80s.  Graham and I had worked - decided we couldn't understand actually why we weren't attracting young talent into the firm and our friend, Noel Robinson, always seemed to be attracting really talented young people into the firm, so, with a marriage broker being Dick Ferris the planner who'd worked with us many years before, we engineered an amalgamation of the practices in '87.  I, as I said earlier, I'm still friends with Noel, but he's not someone who's easy to have as a partner and he was - Graham Bligh became quite disturbed about the way things were happening, so in '89 we busted that relationship and that's when Bligh Voller came into being.  That led to some interesting times. 
00:37:52	We had a bit of a struggle surviving through '90 but by '91 we were up and running and we just had a - well, the firms just gone from strength to strength since then.
RR
00:38:02	That was partly due to diversifying to Sydney and Melbourne, which you and Graham sort of - - -
JV
00:38:10	We engineered.  We'd started experimenting with working offshore and found the  - I'd done a lot of travelling to Indonesia in particular and China and we'd come to the realisation that someone from Brisbane didn't have the same kudos as someone from Sydney or Melbourne and the risks were completely unmanageable in those countries, why don't we expand in Australia.
00:38:45	So, we set about doing that with Graham going to Sydney in '92 - '93 I think and then in '96 I went to Melbourne and both those offices are still firing on.  In fact BVN's biggest office is in Sydney, these days.
RR
00:39:06	It really worked.  It was a strategy that needed to happen and - - -
JV
00:39:10	It did work and unlike a number of other practices - across the board we were one practice and we managed it as one business, not diverse businesses.  We preferred to have an umbrella relationship or something and that brought about some very interesting dynamics and it was in that period of time, starting from the late '80s that I started getting my jollies out of learning what made a business tick and trying to implement those things in our practice, with external advice.
RR
00:39:54	And, considerable success.
JV
00:39:57	Thank you.
RR
00:39:59	Well, I mean, you could see it was happening in reverse, that the other firms were coming up here and establishing.
JV
00:40:05	Yes, that's right.  It was an interesting challenge doing that. Sydney was hard because we - where as Melbourne was easier because we had a big job down there which gave us a cash flow back bone to build on.
RR
00:40:32	And Lawrence came on board at that time?  Lawrence and Graham had been mates.  In fact we had a business together in Queensland, called Bligh Nield Health which showed a lot of promise, it was only practice in Queensland to secure health projects.  We did a few but we couldn't bust into the big boys area like Conrad and Gargett were doing a lot of that work, in those days, the big hospitals and through that relationship, it was decided that when Lawrence stopped being a professor and was looking - after five years or so - looking towards getting his practice into a healthy state, we thought, okay, let's come together.
00:41:28	That was a big turning point for that practice because suddenly we had more kudos in Brisbane.  Because - oh yeah, we've heard of Lawrence Nield.  Bligh, Voller - Hm, yeah, okay.  
JG
00:41:48	What do you consider to be your most important work of the period?
JV
00:41:53	For me, it's not in your period, but, because I was - - -
RR
00:41:56	Because you're too young.
JV
00:41:58	I'm too young, but for me the most significant job is the domestica terminal at Brisbane Airport which was the first big job that I personally brought into the firm.  Ever since then I've been, sorry, from that point on I became a big job junkie and Graham and I often pondered why we kept getting these big projects - they were all different - and we think maybe it was because we approached them with a clean sheet of paper and listened to our clients very carefully and delivered their requirements, their aspirations.
00:42:51	In over a decade we were doing - we did that job, we did the Hyatt Coolum, we did Expo - in partnership with McCormick - we, did the Queensland Police Headquarters and some other projects.  Inside a decade we did the international terminal at Brisbane airport too.  But, the domestic terminal was great, was very hands on.
RR
00:43:22	And it was the best one in the country and it was recognised as such.
JV
00:43:30	Yes, that's,  getting the major gong in the Centenary year was in '88 was an unexpected thing and still a lot of pride in going to Perth to receive the Sir Zelman Cowan Award that year.
RR
00:43:52	Well, I think going to Perth you're aware of - I don't know if it was built then - their airport, I mean it was nothing like as accomplished and yet, built at a similar time, a bit later perhaps.
JV
00:44:08	So, that's definitely the stand out for me.
RR
00:44:11	I can remember a building that I think you were responsible for in Ann Street, just near the People's Palace - was that a new building or was that?
JV
00:44:21	Yes, the Queensland Law Society.  Yes, that was an interesting project with an interesting client and the building's been badly fiddled with since it was built, by others, but so be it, that happens.  Yeah, that was - we argued an interesting case for its design and it's context to the People's Palace, which physically bore no relationship to but it had contextual ideas, if you like, that related to it and through colour and veranda and height etc.
RR
00:45:14	Well, it had the same scale.
JV
00:45:16	That's right, the scale.
RR
00:45:17	Which is a start and probably the most important thing.  
JV
00:45:21	And the chap who was the boss of development in those days, or planner, he accepted it.  It was good, it was an interesting building that.
RR
00:45:40	I guess one of the questions here, we skipped over, who were the architects you most admired in your student year?
JV
00:45:47	I think the local ones were definitely Hayes & Scott and John Dalton.  And, internationally were, stand out for me, was Alvar Aalto.  I still love Scandinavian design.
RR
00:46:07	So, how did you know about Aalto?
JV
00:46:10	From the library.  Someone must have mentioned him in the course because I, you know, I used to look at his works when I was a student.
JG
00:46:23	It's striking that most of the people we interview mention Aalto.
JV
00:46:26	Yeah.
RR
00:46:28	And, yet, in my education, he was unknown.  See, that's a really big difference between the two courses.
JV
00:46:38	You know, the first time I went to Europe, which was '74, I went straight to Scandinavia I didn't go to any other countries.  It was another 20 years before I'd been to France and that was my bag.
RR
00:46:56	On the way to Canada this was, or?
JV
00:46:58	No, no, this was after I came back and had - I hadn't been to Europe by the time I got back here, in '72.  I went there in '74 for the first time.
JG
00:47:13	And, what buildings of Aalto did you visit?  Do you remember?  Saynatsalo?
JV
00:47:20	His opera house in Helsinki I think that is and his museum.  They're the ones I've - and I've been back to Helsinki since.  I like that part of the world.  
RR
00:47:47	Well the tough one I guess here is, which buildings constructed in Queensland between '45 and '75 do you consider significant either personally or generally?
JV
00:48:00	Yeah, I've pondered that question, even having a look through Graham de Gruchy's books on Queensland Architecture, trying to prompt me.  For me the historic - sorry what period are we talking about?
RR
00:48:23	Forty-five, post war '45 to '75.
JV
00:48:26	Pre that period they were historic buildings, like the Bellevue Hotel or the Regatta etc. I love that sort of - I love true Queensland architecture, if it's veranda's etc. but, from that period it's got to be people like Hayes & Scott and John Dalton.  Maybe Lund Hutton and Newell.
RR
00:48:52	So, what of Dalton's.
JV
00:48:54	They're all his houses.  You know.
RR
00:48:55	They were similar.
JV
00:48:57	They were.
RR
00:49:01	I mean, there was one on UQ campus, Zelman Cowan, do you have memories of that?
JV
00:49:08	I can remember it being built.  I lived around the corner from both Hayes and Scott, I knew their kids, knew their architecture and been in their houses, and I'd worked for them, that's the first office I ever worked in, as a very green student.  Helen Mills was there actually, at that time, she - - -
JG
00:49:41	Is she still around, Helen Mills?
JV
00:49:43	Yes, she's a very senior person in the Methodist Church.  She was a partner in our firm in the '70s. 
JG
00:49:52	I know, I saw her name in the - I was fascinated that it was a woman.
JV
00:49:55	It was very unusual for a woman to be a partner in a firm.  It was tough on her too.  Because the contractors basically said - their attitude was, 'What would you know, you're a woman?'  You know, 'Send a real person to the site.' And that really got under Helen's skin and being a very Christian lady she decided, 'No, I'll leave architecture." She became a Minister in the Methodist Church.
JB
00:50:26	When did she decide to become a Minister?

JV
00:50:30	She decided to go and study theology in the late '70s, '78 something like that.  I was a bit - we were quite close, I was a bit hard for her to cop because I'm a bit loose with my language at times, but - - -
JG
00:50:50	Do you think she would be willing to speak to us?
JV
00:50:52	Yes.  She's  really nice lady.
JG
00:50:56	Do you still have her contact data?
JV
00:50:58	No, Graham does.
JG
00:50:59	Graham, okay, I'll ask him.  You said that you like the true Queensland architecture, from before, but do you recognise any of the traits that you consider true Queensland architecture in the more modern buildings as well?
JV
00:51:12	Yeah.  Lightness, verandas, light and shade if you like.
RR
00:51:23	See, Karl Langer had a very different take on that.
JV
00:51:26	He did.
RR
00:51:31	Which side do you - - -
JV
00:51:33	Well l think I've probably shown that, that I'm down the Hayes & Scott, Dalton shaded veranda contemporary house rather than the hardness, the Karl Langer - you know, I can still be stimulated by Karl's work, but no I'm not a champion, if you like, of that.
RR
00:52:05	Both Hayes & Scott and Dalton, when they did get larger work than houses, it seemed to me not to have the same success.  I mean, it was like, they could do the houses but when it came to doing something larger, I'm thinking of the Bardon Professional Centre or some of the university work of Dalton and some of the university work of Hayes & Scott.  That it didn't have the qualities that made them influential.
JV
00:52:51	No.  You're right.  I think Hayes & Scott certainly failed in choosing people to carry on their practice as well, which is a bit sad.  But, handing the baton on, you and I have discussed that a decade or so ago, about how do you draft the right people in to carry on your practice or do you just shut the door.  I don't know that Dalton ever tried actually, because he just retreated to a little town on the Darling Downs.
RR
00:53:37	Allora.	
JV
00:53:41	I should mention some other - I admire the work that Noel Robinson's done in this town and - I don't admire the man - but, I admire the work of Robin Gibson and Seidler and for me one of the best buildings in Brisbane is still the Riverside Centre.  I know Harry would be devastated by what's gone on on that site recently, with jamming in yet another high rise building onto that plaza, because he never intended that to happen.  The original design had quite a small building on that place where a very large building's been done by Fox Rayner.  
00:54:28	But, I think the Riverside Centre is one of the best office buildings done in Australia, ever.   It's a great building for tenants and it's a great building for satisfying space planning needs, because my practice did more than half of it - around half of it when it was first occupied, with the space planning work there.
RR
00:54:57	The tenancies you mean.
JV
00:54:59	The tenancies.
RR
00:55:01	The tenancies, yeah.
JV
00:55:08	I - [00:55:08] work on Southbank has been good for Brisbane, but I prefer the GOMA] solution to - the most recent addition, I think that GOMA is a fantastic builder.
RR
00:55:26	Well the idea of grade separation around those buildings seemed like it was a pretty big problem that, either Brisbane was going to grow sufficiently to make it work or it was never going to work.  And, I took the view that it was never going to work and it was that sort of barbican idea translated or it probably came from the US more than Brittain, what did you think of that idea of raising people up one level above the cars.  Above the streets?
JV
00:56:10	I like it.  I'm not sure it's well handled in its connections across the street, but I think internally the original art gallery worked very well.
RR
00:56:25	Internally, yes.
JV
00:56:26	I don't know - no, I think it was right.
RR
00:56:33	But, I'm talking about externally in the relationship of the rest of the city to those open areas.

JV
00:56:44	Well, it's relationship across the river's good.  It's relationship in its immediate - you know when you get there as a person, maybe is not that well resolved, but, I think it was right.
RR
00:57:01	A little building that I always liked of Hayes & Scott was the Waterside Workers building in Adelaide Street.  Do you remember that at all?
JV
00:57:11	No.  I'm sorry, I don't.
RR
00:57:16	It's almost opposite where I live now and it's being messed with something terrible, but it was one building that was bigger than the houses and yet it did have that finesse.   I thought once about buying it and trying to rescue it but it was all too much.
JV
00:57:43	Well the one you have bought and rescued, that was a Karl Langer design wasn't it?
RR
00:57:46	Mmm.  So, did we get to the end?
JG
00:57:54	I think we got to the end, you mentioned GOMA as a more recent building, are there other recent buildings built in Queensland that you consider worthwhile?
JV
00:58:05	Well, it's nine years since I retreated from Bligh Voller Nield and reading this book that de Gruchy's just put out again, his second volume, on Queensland architecture, I realise that there are a lot of buildings that I don't know about and I wondered why people like Richard Kirk had such a reputation in this town and now I can see why, because he's been doing some pretty interesting buildings that are not well published or whatever.  And, Hassell too, Hassell have done some significant buildings in this town, which I wasn't aware of and so there are not a lot and that's mainly been my choice to be, I guess, a bit - having retreated if you like from the hard edge of the profession.
00:59:14	I still find it a bit surprising when I'm back in there again, at my age, but I'm having fun with where I'm at with Marchese and Partners, very different practice to the one that I was a part of for so long.  They've done me an honour I believe in making me a Principal, a non shareholding Principal, so I have lots of responsibility in my day to day working, but no financial responsibility.  I'm enjoying the work that I'm doing.
MS
00:59:54	So, is that a local firm?
JV
00:59:55	Sydney firm, they've been going 16 or 17 years.  I've know Eugene Marchese, who started it, since the late '90s when we did a job together in Melbourne.  The Docklands.  He's the one that influenced me.  I was doing some consulting work for them, which was how I survived through those seven years or so when I joined them or retreating from BVM and he convinced me to join them full time.
RR
01:00:30	He's Italian?
JV
01:00:31	Italian decent yet.
RR
01:00:34	But not trained in Italy?
JV
01:00:35	No, no, he's an Aussie.  Sydney boy.  Graduated as an architect, went into working for developers and has done his own development work and then started a practice.  Interesting, nice bloke.  All residential, never done a government job, which is weird for me.  Never ever worked for anything other than hardnosed developers.
RR
01:01:05	Right.  And is that what you're still doing?
JJ
01:01:06	Yep.  Working with hardnosed developers in China and Papua New Guinea at the moment which is interesting.  One in China's an interesting bloke, he's an architect, big development company in an interesting town called Shiyan, where the terracotta warriors are.  Yeah, I'm feeling invigorated by it, it's keeping me young.
RR
01:01:37	Well, keep it up, it's working.

JG
01:01:40	Can I just, sorry go back one - how large was Bligh Jessup Bretnall when you arrived there?  How many people worked there?  Do you remember?  More or less.
JV
01:01:49	Yeah, I do.  It hovered between 45 and 60 people for a long while and that was like that when you and I were working there together in the late '60s.
JG
01:02:09	And most of the projects were these larger commissions or did you do - - -
JV
01:02:15	No, no, they were an amazing variety of government work and institutional work, universities etc.  Schools.
JG
01:02:30	Was Gatton Agricultural College?
JV
01:02:33	We did all - yes it was interesting, Arthur Bligh and Graham basically won that work by being commissioned to do a building and then instead of doing - as part of the process of designing the building they offered them a master plan because they could see there was no master plan and they realised that that's what Gatton needed and as a result of that they carried on doing quite a few pieces in the master plan.  That was the way Arthur Bligh thought, you  know, e.g. the Roma Street plan which was well known in the period you were talking about and was something together with  Rider Hunt and another financial institution they did for the city and some of it was implemented.  Unfortunately, not applied to [01:03:35] but that's fine.
01:03:39	Really, you can see the end result of that thinking it's happened that way - down that part of town.  Yes, so - - -
JG
01:03:50	Was there still a lot of residential work going on?
JV
01:03:54	In those days, yes.  Multi residential and singles.  Graham did a lot of single residences including one for John Topley, who's well know at UQ.  The firm didn't really grow beyond that core - it might have got up to 80 when we had big work on, but really didn't take off until we made a success of Sydney and Melbourne.  You know, when I left it was 200 people and a couple of years ago there were over 300 people in the firm.  I've no idea what it is now.  Probably a little less.  Still well over what it was when I left.
RR
01:04:55	Well, some great things have come out of it too.
JV
01:04:58	Yeah, I agree and I think they're still doing great things.
RR
01:05:04	Yeah, they are.
JV
01:05:05	One of the questions in there that we didn't talk about is who - significant people that worked for us.  Graham Davis - I think both Donovan Hill were - both of them were in our office for brief periods.  Robert Ridell was apparently.  Graham I remember very much.  Helen, his Helen Josephson, his wife who's no longer with us, she worked with us as well for, you know - - -
RR
01:05:50	James Grose is somebody who had made a reputation for joining.
JV
01:05:59	Well, no, he worked for us before that and he came to be part of Bligh Jessup Robinson with Noel when Noel joined us and chose to leave in '87 - '88 and for ten years Graham and I berated him about coming back and after ten years of practice he came back because he wanted to get back into big work again and now he's the main man.  He's the national director of BVN which I'm surprised at and he says he loves.  So, that's good.
MS
01:06:45	Well, seems to be to he handled it.  And, Annabelle Lahz was there for a while.
JV
01:06:49	Yeah, Annabelle Lahz was there, you're right, yeah.
RR
01:06:53	And she's in part of a pretty interesting little practice too.  Well not so little any more.
JV
01:07:01	There was a parade of students through the practice.  Because it was one of the larger practices in town and so the students came and went.  I think Graham was held in fairly high esteem by students and felt there was something there could be learnt from working in that office with him.
RR
01:07:25	I can remember getting a call from you at some stage to say, "Come back" and I said, "No" and I said no because I wanted to do a few things that were different to that and I wonder what would have happened had I said yes.  Anyway, that's.
JV
01:07:46	We've all got those moments in our lives I guess, but I'm - I hope that you are like me and look back and think it was all right, it all fell into place without you knowing it at the time.  That's the way I feel.
RR
01:08:04	But I had  great time there, but that was just before I was going to Europe and I really felt QUT had nothing left for me and I was going to go somewhere where I could learn something and in the end it was just where I could get the most money to make that happen and it was on the Gold Coast.  So, I left Bligh Voller or Bligh Jessup Bretnall it was, yes, and went to the Gold Coast and worked for about three firms down there, got as much money as I could and took off.  In those days you didn't need much.  You know, it was fly to London for 399 one way,  if you were under 25, so away you went.
JG
01:08:50	Very different now.
JV
01:08:53	One thing we only touched on that I thinks' pertinent to that period that you're studying is women in architecture.  I believe that our practice and Noel Robinson's practice were the two practices in this town that were equal opportunity employers for women and often was surprised to hear, those that came to work for us, that Noel would ring up and say someone's turned up here, I don't have a job for them do you want me to send them around there?  And, we'd do the same thing.  
01:09:42	There was a bigotry I think, which we didn't ever display and it made us a popular place for women to seek work, and maybe Helen Mills being there in those days was part of that.  
JG
01:10:09	Do you know any other women architects that were active in that period or that were significant in that period? Besides Helen Mills.
RR
01:10:17	Were there any in your course for instance?
JV
01:10:21	No.  No girls in our year.  Robyn Hesse was the year behind I think.  Libby Ord was a year behind, Leckie Ord was a couple of years further back.   There was one ahead of us, whose name I can't remember, a couple of years ahead.  But it was hard for them and I know from talking with Helen it was tough on her and she'd been in New York, living and working in New York on her own, prior to coming back to Brisbane and you know, she was a tough independent person and a very, very good architect.  But, didn't cut it with macho builder blokes.
01:11:21	I think that's an interesting element of that period.  Probably an interesting element in relation to our practice at Bligh Jessup Bretnall too, because Arthur Bligh wasn't all that tolerant of women either I don't think.  That would be one of the few things that, you know, he might be criticised for.  The things that he did in driving the future of Bligh Jessup Bretnall I think is still there today.  You know, they're still underpinning the foundations of the firm.  He had an amazing foresight, if you like, for making an architectural practice just work. 
01:12:12	Tough bloke, didn't suffer fools,  Arthur, at all.
RR
01:12:18	Well, he was kind of up there when I worked there and you didn't really see him very much.
JV
01:12:26	No, that's right.  Okay, I hope that's helped.
JG
01:12:32	Yes, definitely.  I think we've gone through all the questions, unless there's something else that you think you want to add.
RR
01:12:39	Well there will be over the weeks, but we're going to have this public forum.
JG
01:12:45	Yes, but you're abroad.
JV
01:12:47	Yes, but I'm away from the end of - - -
