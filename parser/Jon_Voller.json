Again, he started the practice before then of course.  So, I'm glad you got those tapes because I organised them, before those guys fell of their perches."

You ended up graduating with a lot of real knowledge as well as theoretical knowledge and some of the students that I've employed since that time haven't filled that bill.  But, I must say we've had some very good students in our office in the last two years that - actually from UQ and QUT who amazingly - what's the word - they don't have a lot of knowledge but they're thirsty for it and they listen and they think, rather than sitting there doing exactly what you tell them to do."

He was a likeable chap and he convinced me after first year to stay studying architecture.  I wanted to skip off because I hated the physics and the maths that we had to do in those days.  Following him was Gareth Roberts who had quite a significant influence, I think, on me, and introducing me to have an interest in urban design and I was going to go and study urban design after the course, after talking with him about that.  He went on to be the boss of the NCDC, I think, National Capital Design Commission."

And, then I finished the course under Bal Saini who was, you know, compared with the other two a laconic laid back 'why don't you come home and have a party with us' sort of bloke, you know, he was a pretty good guy and I remained friends with him for a long while."

            "transcript": "The course was okay.  First year was possibly the most exciting.  We were the first year to study under a chap from Melbourne called Bill Carr, who was quite avant garde man, in those days, and set about destroying any preconceptions of design that we might have brought with us into the first year and remoulding them."

Yeah, he was an unusual person and it was good and to see him in contrast with some of the various straight up and down Scotsman like Bill Gregg and Hamish Murison  were a bit weird, but, delightful. And, even Stan  Marquis-Kyle, but Stan Marquis-Kyle was a beaut bloke too.  A technical type chap, but when it came to design and drafting; whereas if you could convince Bill that you could draw better in your own blood he'd be happy about that, you know."

I would have thought that there were some ructions and I can't remember them but, you know, he was so different that it must have been problematic and I'm sure that someone like Stan Marquis-Kyle would have stilled the waters on a regular basis.  Although he was an old fashioned bloke, Cummings, the professor, he was  free thinking guy too you know, he could think the big picture; I mean he's the one who would have employed Bill Carr anyway."

And, when you go into practice you've got to run a business and if you don't, you don't survive very well.  So, I don't know whether the courses have changed.  From talking to students I don't think they have, particularly."

The other interesting bloke we had who came to us in third year, was our design master, was Graham de Gruchy and he remained a friend for a long while too and he was - Ian Sinnamon too who came to the school while I was there.  I'd know Ian when I was a ten year old because he'd done his time with my old man.  I think he might have even been - not apprentice - but, the word you could study architecture by working under - - -"

Bill made me into a modernist, I don't know.  But, I've always been more interested in what's happening now.  It's the same in art.  I have no great desire to look at contemporary art, very modern art, not that much interested in going to see the Masters."

We used to look at magazines a lot - to help us to design projects - I mean, I can remember a few instances where there was a project like Sea Ranch on the west coast of the US and that got passed around among the students and saying, 'this is where it's at' and you know, the course wasn't doing that the course was doing something, for me - but it wasn't your UQ course I'm talking about QIT."

That's Bruce Goodsir, Bruce Carlyle and myself and Stan Marquis-Kyle used to refer to us as the firm, first year.  Bruce Goodsir  went on to be a significant educator and designer and artist.  I've lost touch with him now, he's been in Tasmania for 30 years.  Bruce Carlyle went on and worked with Robin Gibson for a long while and then I think decided to go and make some money, so he went and worked in construction and became senior man in Watkins then ended up as the senior bloke in John Holland on the construction side.
