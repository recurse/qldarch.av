INTERVIEW WITH DUNCAN MCPHEE
7 SEPTEMBER, 2012

DM  
00:00:01	...it’s 53 years since I graduated.  Well, finished the course, put it that way, and you know, the questions you sent me are fairly searching.  I realised that that could take too many hours or so.  So, I thought, well I’d better let you make the rain.
JG
00:00:26	So, before we get started, could I ask you to have a look at the consent from that allows us to use the material that we gather from this interview and if you could have a look and sign on the first and second page; if you agree with what’s in the - - -
DM
00:00:46	This is the university ethics is it?
JM
00:00:48	Yes.  Exactly.
DM
00:00:49	I’ve heard about that.
	Okay.  Now, you’re called the Head of School, in my day it was the Dean of Architecture.
JM
00:01:04	I’m both actually, I’m the Dean and Head.
DM
00:01:06	Right.  Right.  Okay.  And, Janina is your personal secretary or what?
JM
00:01:12	No, Janina is a post doctoral researcher who’s come to join us, so she’s worked on similar issues, 1970’s, 1960’s post war architecture in Belgium and she’s just finished her PhD.  So, I’m friends with her supervisor, so, she’s come out for a couple of years to work with us on this project.
DM

00:01:30	And, you’ve got somebody else Deborah.
JG
00:01:33	Deborah.
JM
00:01:33	Van der Plaat.
DM
00:01:36	And, is she is a similar situation?
JM
00:01:39	She’s also a post doc fellow in the school, yeah.  And, Andrew Wilson, who did the book on Hayes & Scott, he’s involved in the project as well.  There’s a few of us.
DM
00:01:50	I’ve got that and it’s down at Stradbroke.  I mean, I had to build a house at Stradbroke because I had too many books.  Mr Gargett gave me this huge table and it was one that was built for the firm in 1928 and I didn’t have the heart to throw it out, it was far too big for this house, so I had to design the house around that table.  So, it all worked out very well.
JM
00:02:20	So, just to tell you a bit about the project.  So, it’s a project funded by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council and we’re basically trying to record a lot of post war architectural history in Queensland, because no one has really done it.  So, the way we approached it was to partner up with the State Library and with some of the bigger older firms, like Conrad Gargett, Wilsons and BVN, and Robert Riddell, because he’s interested in heritage and so is another partner.  So, it’s the four architectural firms, the State Library and UQ and we’re leading it.  Really, what we’re trying to do is just tap your memories and try and get a big – a part of what we’re asking I guess is just straight information you know.  Who you know when you worked and so on.  But, we’re also interested, I guess, in the sort of attitudes and ideas that people had.	
DM
00:03:12	Yeah, fine, okay.  
JM
00:03:14	And, what we hope to do is – out of that – is to get together a mass of information so we actually can place all the people who worked on what projects, but we’re also heading toward an exhibition.	
DM
00:03:25	So, I’ve seen, in 2014.
JM
00:03:27	It will happen at the State Library in 2014, yeah.  So, in order to do that, so this from really lets us use the material you’re going to say today for research purposes and it will mean that the sound recording will be available in the State Library in future.
DM
00:03:42	Right, okay.
JM
00:04:16	Great.  Thanks very much.  
DM
00:04:50	I’ve heard the clock strike ten.
JM
00:04:52	So, we’re on time.  And, here we are interviewing Duncan McPhee, in Royston Street, Brookfield.  I’m John Macarthur with Janina Gosseye and it’s the 7th of September, 2012.
00:05:17	Great Duncan, so what we thought we start is just with a series of questions about your early history.  So, we’re interested in what your architectural qualifications were when you began to study architecture, even what inspired you to start studying architecture, a little bit about that.
DM
00:05:35	It’s a good story too, because my mother was very keen that I be an architect.  I was not so keen.  I wanted to be a mining engineer because, I realise now I was swept up with the romance of the underground - because later I became a caver - but that’s another story.  The reality is that my mother and father, when I passed my senior examination in the end of 1953, I still hadn’t made a decision.  I was taken to various people for advice and my father used to say, “Well, I don’t want him to be an architect, they’re the first ones out picking the roads in any sort of depression.”  I always remember that.  Whereas, mum had sent me to study art under Vida Lahey when I was seven years old.  I kept up painting until I was 18 years old, more than that, because I finished when I was in third year I think.  I used to study under Melville Haysom, Margaret McNeil and of course Vida Lahey when I was a small boy and continued on. This was instead of having cricket on Friday afternoons at state school.  Which, was a terrible thing to miss out on apparently.  Although, I didn’t mind at all.
JM
00:07:16	Where were you studying with Vida Lahey?
DM
00:07:18	In Brisbane.  She had a children’s art class in Bible House, top floor, in George Street.  And, there I met Elizabeth Cummings, who became quite a well known artist.
JM
00:07:35	She certainly is.
DM
00:07:36	And, her wildcat brother Malcolm.  And, I remember Elizabeth was very scathing about one painting I did.  She thought I’d copied hers.  I can’t remember now whether I did or I didn’t.  But, anyhow, I look back and I see this really was the beginnings of architecture for me because it taught me to rely on the hand and in those days of course architecture was always presented by hand drawings, good lettering etc. etc., which continued - I have to say mum won the argument - after I started to study first year architecture under Professor Cummings.
JM
00:08:25	Duncan, did you happen to meet Romeo Lahey?  Vida’s brother?
DM
00:08:29	Yes, I knew Romeo quite well because my parents were in the National Parks Association and my thesis was a bit of a worry to Romeo Lahey, so - - -
JM
00:08:49	You were proposing a tourist facility in national parks were you, or - - -
DM
00:08:51	Beside the national park.
JM
00:08:53	Beside it okay.
DM
00:08:54	In Running Creek.  But - - -
JM
00:08:56	These people, the Laheys are very interesting people, but, I found out recently, from Romeo’s daughter that he did a Town Planning qualification at the Bartlett, after World War I, before he was repatriated back to Australia.
DM
00:09:09	Yes he did.  I’ve read her book just recently.  The Lahey family it is and they lived, both in Canungra and of course in Corinda, very close to where my brother lives now and there’s a marvellous house just three doors up in Clewley Street that belonged to the Laheys.  So, obviously the whole Lahey family, included David, Romeo’s father, were interested in architecture because quite recently, I discovered an absolute jewel of architecture in Canungra, which is the Anglican Church there, done by Ray – I’ve just forgotten his other name at the moment – but, this architect, whose name I can’t – I’ll remember soon – Nowland, Ray Nowland.
JM
00:10:11	Raymond Nowland, Raymond Clare Nowland, yeah.
DM
00:10:13	Yes, he had studied in England, after the first World War – this is my wife Edith.
JM
00:10:23	Hello Edith.
DM
00:10:23	John Macarthur and Janina Gosseye.  This is Edith.  She’s very busy at the moment.
JM
00:10:46	Yes,  Sir Nowland was State Government architect for many years.
DM
00:10:49	Yes.  I didn’t realise he was the government architect, I knew he worked there, but this church is, to me, superb.  Inside as well as out.  Just opposite the hotel in Canungra.
JM
00:11:03	I’ll go and have a look at it next time I’m down that way.
DM
00:11:06	Well, try and get a look inside, especially in the afternoon with the sun coming through from the Western wall, it just glows with this magnificent interior of red cedar.
JM
00:11:18	So, you knew something of architecture through the Laheys and through the younger Cummings, who were in your art class.
DM
00:11:25	Well, no, I didn’t then.  Malcolm, and although we were much the same age, I always thought it was – oh, I’d better not say that – that he was a bit of a mad cap and I didn’t really know him as well as I knew Elizabeth, his eldest sister.  But, it wasn’t until I started architecture in first year that I got to know the Cummings because the professor there was, to me, I was never a great student, but I had in my year – and it was a very small year of seven, in first year – two brilliant people.  One was Malcolm and the other was David Strachan who I’d had been from kindergarten through all the schools right through to first year architecture and then beyond for the whole of the course.  David had an incredible talent for drawing, he was very gifted academically, as was another boy in our state school class, but unfortunately he died in 1996 from cancer.  And, I, by comparison with those two, very low on the scale in first, second and third year. 
00:13:04	 In fact, having said all that, we were surrounded by architects in St Lucia – where I lived as a boy – got to know them pretty well;  I remember doing work, helping Archie Long on the competition that he was doing for a war memorial and I remember he gave me £2 for giving all the help I gave.  To me that was a fortune in what must have been 1947 I suppose.
JM
00:13:38	So, what year did you start?
DM
00:13:39	Nineteen fifty-four.  And, that was my first year.  Before that I had one of the architects lived next door to me was Leo Drinan who designed the university for Hennessy & Hennessy.  He and Jack Hennessy designed it, so I was associated with the beginnings of the university at St Lucia, although, as a small boy because St Lucia was 50 percent bush in those days and it was a marvellous area; open grazing country on the end of the pocket there where the university was actually built.  So, Leo Drinan was next door, always helpful, I didn’t appreciate what he was doing, of course, because I was only a boy.  But, the next door neighbour towards Swann Road – and this is, now I’m talking the areas between Carmody and Swann Road, up there – used to be called St Lucia Heights, where my parents had built a house before they were married.
JM
00:14:52	What street was that on?
DM
00:14:55	That’s on 15 Carmody Road, now and the house has been sold some years ago.  But mum lived there until she died there, in 2006.  However, the next door house to the Drinan’s, there was actually a bare block and the house belonged to Archie Long and mum had told me that he’d actually studied with one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s students in America;  I don’t know for how long because the only clue I had was his writing in the house he built – which is still there – and that’s - - -
JM
00:15:39	How did you mother have such interest in architecture?  How was she interested in Frank Lloyd - - -
DM
00:15:42	Mum was a – she didn’t ever tell me about Frank Lloyd Wright or any of this, it was only that there was something inside me that could remember the inside plans of houses.  Even when I was quite young.  I could go away and I knew how the house was laid out.
JM
00:16:05	You had good cognitive mapping, you could remember the special arrangements.  Interesting.
DM
00:16:08	Probably, yes.  But, I remember these magnificent folding steel windows he had downstairs.  You entered through the garage which I didn’t like much, but to get in the front door you had to descent into a little tiny garden and then go in the front door.  But, as a boy of course, I always went in either down the long stairs through the kitchen or through the garage and the descent from the garage down these softly upholstered stairs, with carpet, I mean, that was very unusual and down into this marvellous room that Arch had built on the ground floor, which could open in over a long settee into the back garden, which was stunning.  I thought.
00:17:02	Now, Archie probably is unknown to most architects today.
JM
00:17:08	I’m familiar with the name but I couldn’t name a building he did or - - -
DM

00:17:11	No.  But, he did – much later in life – work for Conrad and Gargett and he worked on St John’s Cathedral, that was the drawings there along with Ian Charlton and a few other talented members of the Conrad and Gargett staff in those years.
00:17:31	But, I’m getting off the track aren’t I, because you - - -
JM
00:17:33	Yeah you are, but we can wander around a little bit.  But, I was just thinking about Karl Langer and Gertie’s house was built in St Lucia.  Did you see that when it was being built?
DM
00:17:42	Yes, they were great friends of my parents.  As was Peter Newell, but, I greatly admired that house of Karl Langer’s.  Only when I got inside it and could appreciate - - -
JM
00:17:58	The way that it folds away at the back into the bush and - - -
DM
00:18:01	Yes, and the way you could sit at the dining room table.  And, although it was a tiny block, he had a good vista to the right and into the house.  It really set a resonant chord with me.
JM
00:18:16	So, in those first years, who were the teachers who really inspired you?  Did you have much to do with Bob Cummings or with Langer or who else was teaching?
DM

00:18:25	Okay.  Stan Marquis Kyle had TB and he was in the sanitorium at Kenmore here and he used to come in and he really inspired me – would you believe – on vintage cars.  He and I ended up then rescuing a few wrecks and I was sold a beautiful car by him when I was in – 1956, so that’s third year, early part of third year – I bought this Belgian Minerva, which I still have would you believe.
00:19:09	The other day I did visit Stan, he’s in a nursing home just on the next ridge.
JM
00:19:15	I didn’t realise he was still alive.  I know Peter a little bit.
DM
00:19:19	Yes.
JM
00:19:20	I met Stan when he – my first year at university – and he’d had his stroke and was unable to teach any more.
DM
00:19:24	That’s right, yeah.  But, I took along a copy of the Vintage Car Club magazine for him because I could see he could read all right, there was the Sunday Mail beside him.  But, he was trying to talk to me but it was no go.
JM
00:19:38	Do you know a fellow called Bob Pope?
DM
00:19:40	Yes, very well.  He and I studied art a the - - -
JM
00:19:46	He’s my uncle.  
DM
00:19:47	Is he really?
JM
00:19:48	Yeah, I think we met a long time ago at one of the car club things that Bob was involved in.  Because, my uncle’s a builder and a vintage car nut.
DM
00:19:59	Well he did architecture too.
JM
00:20:03	That’s right, he worked for Joe and then went off into building here.
DM
00:20:07	But, he and I met first of all in Saturday morning free hand drawing classes		at what was then, Central Technical College, now QUT, under Mr Graham.
JM
00:20:20	So, there’s Stan Marquis Kyle, did you have much to do with Bob Cummings in your first couple of years?
DM
00:20:25	Yes.  He used to lecture us on principles of architecture and also design.  He, obviously, with Bruce Lucas had mapped out the whole architecture course, in those days – we’re looking back.  I’m just so grateful that I got such a broad education in those first three years at uni when I had no idea what really architecture meant.  In fact, I was lost in a way and we had the great fortune of starting off two years down at the old buildings in Central Technical College on the upper floor overlooking the gardens and it was just hard work.
00:21:20	And, then in third year we got a place in the tower at the university and they’d set it up very well.
JM
00:21:34	We’ve got some pictures from that period that would have – that Bob Cummings or someone in the school would have taken – of people working in the library and the tower.
DM
00:21:41	Yeah.  I remember him well because every year he and Mrs Cummings – I can’t think of her first name now – but, they would put on an end of year party for the whole of the faculty and today that would be huge, but in those days it wasn’t all that huge.  And, not everybody turned up and it was very good to have that party.  I was talking to Hal Davis recently, who’s an architect from that era - - -
JM
00:22:16	Hal Davis.  I don’t know that name either.
DM
00:22:19	He was a commonwealth department architect and he was interested in everything.  We were both keen members of the university bush walking club, but he spent a – what to me was -  a fortune on a Leica camera in those days and he took photographs, especially pretty girls, but recently these have all been put on digitised, blown up and it’s really remarkable the quality of the early Leica camera.
JM
00:22:57	Have they got pictures of people in the school at that time or?
DM
00:23:01	Yeah, well what reminded me of this, he took a photograph of us at one of the parties.  Well, other, you’ve asked about the pro-office – we used to call him – and he was a fairly serious person in a way and therefore these parties at the end of the year were seemingly a little bit unusual, shall we say, that’s just silly because I look back know and really realise how, unbeknown to me, they were giving us a gentle shove here and a gentle shove there, or dismissing them if they didn’t think they were going to succeed in architecture.  That’s the students, because of course, I was betwixt and between really, as I say the first three years were difficult for me.  
00:24:37	But, now I’m terribly grateful I didn’t, because in fourth year I experienced a moment of inspiration, shall we say, because  the Presbyterian Church ask the prof if we could design a chapel for them at Alexandra Headlands at their youth camp, a place I knew well because I used to go there from the time I was ten, and the prof drove us up in his car one day.  Just those who were going to compete and as we drove away I can suddenly see what I was going to do.  Now, that’s not all that remarkable is it, but, anyhow, David Strachan – this fellow who I greatly admired and probably was envious of a bit, would sometimes drop in on me.  He’d just come around the back of the house and I’d be in my room downstairs and he’d say hello.  He was a very affable fellow. Well, after we’d prepared the drawings for the competition – he saw the model – we had to build a model as well – in the middle of the room and I’ll never forget the look on his face.  He looked like this, at the model, and I thought, ‘Hello, I’ve achieved something here.’  Well, to cut a long story short, I wont the competition and I’ve got a photograph of my face beside the model somewhere - £21 for competition or for prize, on the front of the Telegraph newspaper.  They were very ‘out of news’ that day I think.  But, it was 20 guinea prise and once I won that I suddenly realised that I could achieve something.
JM
00:26:40	Gave you confidence, yeah.
DM
00:26:41	Gave me confidence, and that was to be repeated years later when – after being with other firms – after being – in those years, we had three years full time, three years part time – in the three years part time we worked during the day and at night attended lectures and then went on into the early hours of the morning doing our project.  Well - - -
JM
00:27:14	Which firms did you work with in your latter three years?
DM
00:27:18	Goodsir & Carlisle for a start, that was 1957 and 1958.  I realised – I really loved it there because I just walked to walk, there was an office in the garden, looked out into the bush and a gully at the back, just around the corner near the Ironside School and, well, there were birds perching in the trees outside watching us work – and Bill Goodsir and Harold Carlisle were – in a way – a good match for each other.  Bill the businessman, Harold the magnificent renderer was architect.  But, both of them were designers.  We had quite a – another fellow there and I became very friendly – that was Rob Retchford who was absolutely brilliant at being able to measure a building and draw it in no time flat in the most magnificent drafting and working drawings, no trouble.  I’ve never known anybody do a working drawing as fast as he could.
00:28:36	Well, eventually – he’d been there quite a long time – when there was a bit of a difference of opinion with Bill Goodsir and they parted.  This was after I left and Rob went off and started designing buildings across the Pacific, especially the Pacific Islands.  Made quite a good living out of that I think.
JM
00:29:03	Was he working under his own name or?
DM
00:29:06	Yes.  He now lives in Hobart and - - -
JM
00:29:10	And, his family name again?
DM
00:29:12	Retchford.  Robin Retchford, and he lives just outside of Hobart.  I went and saw him about 2002 when my daughter and I were on an adventure walk across the South Coast of Tasmania.  He and Judy were very friendly while I was working with them and they’d invite me to dinner at Judy’s place or – Rob came from Western Australia; I don’t know anything about his father, he loved his mother and was always talking and looking after mum.  But, then,  that was Goodsir Carlisle for two years, then I stupidly probably - Bill Goodsir promised me a rise of ten shillings a week every six months. Well, he forgot about it and I as too proud to remind him.  Then, another firm, fairly close by, Job and Froud were building Torbreck Highgate Hill, so, I applied for a job there, and I got it and there was some other exciting young architects working for him, like Don Spencer and particularly Bob Clayton who, once again, Bob and I got very friendly, he introduced me to [00:30:55] as I remember.  He had a tiny little room just up and across the railway line.  He was originally from Townsville and he finally went back to Townsville; worked for Lund Hutton and Newell and was – well with others – was responsible for a fine building in Townsville which is the Law Courts there.
JM
00:31:26	Yes, I admire that building, it’s heavy and monumental but it’s very well done.
DM
00:31:33	Yes, I think so.  Well, that was for four years I worked for Job and Froud.
JM
00:31:40	What was Froud like?
DM
00:31:42	He was the most, the nicest guy you could ever meet.  Sensitive, talented, that Torbreck for instance, Noel Kratzmann the builder came down because it was his building, down one storey, and said to Aubrey Job and Bob, he wanted to build a block of flats on Highgate Hill, would they do him a scheme.  That was on – as I understand it – the Friday night.  Monday morning, Bob brought in this – probably a drawing about this size – and it was for this tower, monumental tower, with a garden block and shops.
JM
00:32:32	The whole conception was - - -
DM
00:32:34	The whole conception, just on the back of an envelope sort of thing, and this is the way he would work, because he’d come in on Monday morning and give me the back of an envelope and say give us the working drawings or do a sketch plan of that; but that was after I’d been there quite some time.
JM
00:32:54	What project did you work on with Job and Froud?
DM
00:32:58	Not so much on Highgate Hill, although I did the – would you believe – the sculptural rows inside the observation tower to show where everything was around Brisbane.
JM
00:33:15	That’s yours is it?
DM
00:33:17	Yes and then I saw they were having a 50 year reunion so I took my walking group back there one Thursday and met one of the residents.  When she heard that I’d been a worker on the building she couldn’t do enough for me, and shown over the whole building, they were terribly proud of the place.  So, that was a big lift too.
JM
00:33:43	Quite a few architects live there now.
DM
00:33:44	How many.
JM
00:33:45	Quite a few architects live there now.
DM
00:33:46	Oh, really.  Well, I used to think it was a bit small, because that was an error when costs were dominant and the rooms were small, but Bob was doing marvellous little houses and – up in Noosa – and Aubrey was doing beautiful big houses around Brisbane here.  One he did for Taylor, the builder at Fig Tree Pocket.  He lavished time and energy on that.
JM
00:34:19	I don’t know that project.
DM
00:34:20	For his brother in law, a house in Indooroopilly, I did the working drawings and looked after it.
JM
00:34:28	You don’t remember what streets those houses were, do you?  The Indooroopilly one?
DM
00:34:33	The Indooroopilly one is in Central Avenue, I think.
JM
00:34:37	That’s a long street.
DM
00:34:40	It could have been demolished and a unit built now.  Unfortunately, some of these fine buildings that architects did in that era, many Hayes & Scott ones, and of course – I’m not immune myself – have been demolished.  Because they were on valuable blocks of land.  
00:35:05	So, anyhow, you did ask me about other lecturers and then you asked me about then after four years at Job and Froud, I got into a disappointing situation here, where I had – on my own – been designing houses in far Western Queensland and Central Queensland.  Mainly, on big properties.  My father may have had a small influence in that he had clients in those areas – I don’t know – I also had a friend who lived in - - -
JM
00:35:42	Were you doing those through Job and Froud or just on your own?
DM
00:35:45	No, just on my own at night.  You know, just to supplement my income, which I mean was £13 a week, at that time; because they were having a hard time financially.  Over Torbreck, they were two builders who went bankrupt there and they just weren’t being paid.  So, once again it was a bit about pay and I thought, although Rob and I – I really appreciated him – it wasn’t until years afterwards I realised that they probably appreciate me too, because he rang me up and I asked him to come and see me at Stradbroke, where I’d just finished this house, just for a bit of advise and put them up for the weekend, and also they were – both of them were very likeable people, but they were primarily artists and I got a beaut founding in that, but, how do you counter the economic factor when it’s so great, as in the Torbreck problem.
00:37:04	So, I realised then, after doing one house in far Western Queensland and it was a huge house, and it was a period about 1961 – 1962 when building was going gang busted, very hard to get prices in far Western Queensland, but I did, but it was too much for the owner he said, “No, cut it back” so, I cut it back; he didn’t want to reduce the plan he was happy with the plan, he just wanted to cut the price.  Well, I tried with builder’s help – two builder’s help – well, in the end I asked Bob what should I do – Bob Froud – he said if I were you I’d give this job up, I think it sounds bad.  Because, we’d had a few like that and I didn’t like it because my father had got me this job, but anyhow, I was a bit worried about talking to dad about it, but in the end, they came to see me these clients and I realised they were just – I was going to have terrible problems and I said, “Look I don’t want to go ahead with this.”  Well, that really upset them.  They didn’t pay me and I thought, well, that’s very disappointing, I’d spent all that money.  
00:38:34	But, I realised that I needed more experience and I thought, well who would I get this from.  I remember my father saying that Conrad – that’s Arnold Conrad  and Bren Gargett – were very sound; that was the word around Brisbane.  Very sound and I thought, that’s the sort of experience I need.  So I sent and saw Mr Gargett – always Mr Gargett – till I got older, it was Bren Gargett and I showed him what I’d been doing and he said we’ve  been trying for ages to get somebody like you, you’re on.  What do you want for the pay?  So, in my brash moment, I said £14 a week, because I’d been getting 13.  He said, “Oh, I think we can manage that.”  Within three months they’d raised my pay three times and that was the second huge boost I got in my experience as a young architect.  
00:39:52	From then on, that was 1962 I joined them and I was there for – well I had to voluntarily retire as a director in 2001, but they say, “Look, we want you to stay on one day a fortnight, just to look after the building and the superannuation fund.  Will you do that?”  I said, “Oh yes, that’s all right.”  So, I used to go in for another four years, one day a fortnight, so that meant I was over 40 years at Conrad and Gargett and of course, in those early years, it was a big firm; it was nearly 100 people.
JM
00:40:40	We’ll talk about Conrad Gargett in a minute, I just want to ask a couple more questions about your early career, and I guess particularly what you and your younger colleagues, at the school and then in practice, what kind of architects they admire.  I guess I’m most interested in overseas architects, but also what you made of what was happening in Brisbane at the time.
DM
00:41:02	Okay, for what was in Brisbane, there were some older students than I was.  People like Bob Glazebrook, John Dalton, Rob Gibson and I’m bound to leave others out; Blair Wilson and Gordon Briggs and I’m bound to leave others out.  Having said that, Mr Gargett jumped down my throat once when we were out in the car together and I said “I”, he said it’s not “I, it’s we” and I’m very conscious that it is a group that everybody has got their talents.  If you can bond them together you’ve got a great team.  Well I was to discover that later, but, and I got off the track again, I’m sorry.
00:42:02	It was the other people that we admired  - - -
JM
00:42:05	Were you looking at what Hayes & Scott were doing? Would that - - -
DM
00:42:09	Very much so.  Because, I only mentioned the students there, the students with me.  But, even some firms that you probably don’t know much about these days, like, Theo [Thynne 00:42:25] and Peter Heathwood and Nutter and Charlton of course, that’s Dan Nutter and Ian Charlton.  Gosh, and I haven’t even started.  There are just hundreds of architects – no, that’s an exaggeration – I knew many architects and everyone of them, as I became more experienced, I began to appreciate what they’d done.  Though earlier I mentioned the neighbours, in fact, and then there was Karl Langer of course.  There were people like Geoff Felton who were very good friends of my family.  He was an architect, ended up in Neutral Bay in Sydney and Horace Driver did my grandmother’s house and the house next door the Sieman’s house to us.
JM
00:43:33	The people like Driver and [Trewin 00:43:35] and so on, they must have been pretty old hat to you young fellows in the ‘60s or?  Or was there respect for that kind of more traditional architecture or?
DM
00:43:43	No I respected them, because, Rod Voller was a very good friend of my mother’s and Rod, I could see she admired him the whole of her life, he – as a wedding present to my parents – did the house, which is now 15 Carmody Road, and later of course - - -
JM
00:44:09	So, that’s Voller, okay.	
DM
00:44:10	That was Rod Voller, the original house, 1934 – 1933 I suppose he would have started it.   I’ve even got some sketch plans he started to do, which mum altered, but then Leo Drinan did an extension – enclosed what mum used to call the piazza later- and so, on but I’ll get off the track again if I go on to all that.
JM
00:44:34	So, you admired the older architects in the pre war period?
DM
00:44:37	Yes, I did.
JM
00:44:38	But, your contemporaries?
DM
00:44:40	Well, I remember.  One time - - -
JM
00:44:42	Case study houses and flat rooves and things like that were they?
DM
00:44:47	I must admit in 1947, when I saw the new skillion roof architecture after the war, I was horrified, I just didn’t like it at all.  I can’t explain; it just looked cheap and nasty to me.  So, there was something there stirring of course, but I can’t tell you what it was, in my early years.
JM
00:45:18	So, it was at school that you learnt modernism.  How do people like Cummings and Langer put modernist architecture in this longer historical theme?  Did they see it as a massive break or?
DM
00:45:31	They did, yes, from the 1890s on, that was modern architecture.  And, we all admired that.  In fact, that’s inculcated into all of us students in those days.
JM
00:45:47	Just recently, I just gave a lecture the other week about Santa Barbara by [Truhan 00:45:51] and next to it there’s a house by Driver and one of them’s Spanish and one of them is old English, and I guess that’s the kind of thing you were taught not to do, or?
DM
00:45:59	That’s right, we were that was because – I was going to say earlier – that Vida Lahey and Professor Cummings were very keen not to teach us architecture, we had to develop our own ideas on architecture, on design.
JM
00:46:21	Moving through to when you were starting work, what kind of international architecture did you look at?  What were the heroes of the day, what magazines were you reading?
DM
00:45:33	Yeah.  Well, they had a good library in the architecture department.  Third year I started reading Frank Lloyd Wright’s books and to me it was gobbly gook.  One year later I picked them up again and it was inspiring.  So, Frank Lloyd Wright of course, Walter Burleigh Griffin I greatly admired, especially after driving up to Ipswich and seeing that magnificent incinerator and this is before it was turned into a theatre.  And, indeed I tried to write down a few of them here, but, the brothers Greene in Pasadena.  That was the sort of work we were doing we were doing at Job and Froud.  That sort of quality of the work and the reason I wanted to join Job and Froud, by this time I had formed a philosophy of architecture, no – how shall I say – it was something that was in my mind that would help me and guide me in the future and that was a certain single simple form characterises a work of architecture and also Bob Cummings would say that this climate here in Brisbane, with its intensity of ultra violet light is destructive to our buildings and he would be very careful about the orientation taught us about the sun angles and so forth.
00:58:20	So, therefore this house here is oriented to 15 degrees East of North, following his principles, but to me that translated and I realised just thinking about this, this came up in this thesis of mine where I said the characteristic of Queensland Architecture was a [Don and 00:48:43] form and – anyhow, I won’t go into that, but.
JM
00:48:50	We are very interested in that.  We’re interested I guess in the local professions sense of self identity, I mean how much people identified, what they were doing as building an ethos of architecture in Queensland, as opposed to elsewhere.
DM
00:49:03	Okay, well Oscar Niemeyer inspired Hayes & Scott and Marcel Breuer in California and in Chicago too I think.  I had an experience there recently where they tried to pull down his building and they wouldn’t let him, in Chicago.  So, they were leaders overseas architecture and of course, Frank Lloyd Wright was on the opposite spectrum to most of these other architects.
JM
00:49:43	But you were encouraged by Cummings and Langer and so on to always think about developing these ideas, specifically for here rather - - -
DM
00:49:54	Of course.  Yes.
JM
00:49:56	But was there a sense of it being a regional culture, the talk back to the world, or?
DM
00:50:04	Yeah.  I hadn’t thought of that so much because that was something I did harp on almost in this thesis and I wasn’t conscious of absorbing that from them but it could be so because they worked us pretty hard.  
JM
00:50:22	I was thinking about your interest in bush walking and nature and so on.  Both Langer and Cummings were very involved in nature conservation and you had that through the Laheys as well, so, Cummings was involved in the formation to Binna Burra wasn’t he?
DM
00:50:36	Yes, yes he was.  He used to go - - -
JM
00:50:38	And, Karl and Gertie had a lot to do with conserving that gulley behind their house and replanting it.
DM

00:50:45	Yes.
JM
00:50:47	So, do you think they had a particular ethos.  Like, interest in nature conservation and - - -
DM
00:50:53	I always had that really, that was inculcated by my parents.  Their backyard was described by one of my friends, when he first saw it, he asked my father if he’d shot any Japs there recently.  And, this was after the war, because it was such a jungle.  But, it looked out over the university land in those days.
JM
00:51:18	When you said before that Cummings made the fuss about orientation and 14 and 15 degrees East and North and so on, that was from Cummings not Langer.  Because, now a days we think it’s because Langer did all the work on the solar geometry and so on, but you had those lectures from Cummings rather than from Langer.
DM
00:51:37	Yes.  Karl Langer lectured us in town planning only.
JM
00:51:41	Only in planning, yeah.
DM
00:51:43	And, that was mainly in third year – no, it was fourth year too.  I don’t think it was third year, I think it was fourth year.  But, Karl – Gertie was a great mate of my mothers but she was a very fierce art critic.  My mother was an artist and I think she might have been a bit in awe of Gertie Langer.
JM
00:52:08	I think a lot of people were.
DM

00:52:10	Yes.  And, Karl was not quite as easy to – how shall I say – to get to know.  It was only after he’d died and the house was for sale that I ever say the inside.  And, yet they were such great mates of my parents.  He was a quite fellow, but I wouldn’t say at all that he had – he would have been influencing us in orientation in town planning, but not – it was Prof Cummings who really emphasised it.
JM
00:52:53	It seems like Langer was a bit of a polarising figure, now that we’ve heard different people talk about whether or not he was up to his own estimation of himself and particularly about the engineering of some of the buildings because he claimed to do his own engineering.  Because there was a controversy I think when he was taken off the Main Roads project.
DM
00:53:12	Was there, I see.
JM
00:53:14	But, do you have any recollection of that?
DM
00:53:16	No, I never knew that.   Because, I hadn’t got to be a close association with him, I had to get involved with Gertie Langer because I had to run the NUAUS Art Competition for Queensland at one time, which was - - - NUAUS – National Association of University Students – and that meant I had to collect art from the South and up here and display it in the Darnell Gallery and I asked Gertie, amongst others, to be the judge.
JM
00:54:03	That’s great.  Well, let’s move back to the Conrad Gargett period then and talk through some of the first projects you were working on there and the ones that you think were significant achievements.
DM
00:54:16	Right.  I was worried by than in Janina’s because I thought, what’s the best I’ve ever done and you know Frank Lloyd Wright’s classic response to that was, “Oh, the next one dear boy, the next one.”  And, of course, all my jobs were my children.  I felt, you know, you can’t tell one job against the other, they all have incredible and sometimes very trying births and then as they’re being erected the stress rises fantastically.  So, anyhow, to get back to my time at Conrad and Gargett, I was put upstairs in 1865 House in Leichhardt Street.  They had, as their main office, Needham House on the other side; as I say they were about 96 then, maybe 100.
JM
00:55:33	They must have been by far the biggest firm in the city at that stge.
DM
00:55:35	Yes, yes.  And, oh well I suppose I was a pretty small wheel, I certainly thought myself of that; I did work with Paquita Day, who I knew well in the bushwalking club. She was a few years older and she designed the Squash Court at St John’s College and I did the working drawings then off that and did the, what we used to call, the supervision of it.  And, I took all supervision as very serious.  Today you’ve got project manager and you’ve got code and so forth, but in those days it was entirely different.  You were responsible.
00:56:22	Now that was the first, then I moved up a step a bit, they gave me a job to do at Church of England Grammar School, Churchie as it was called then, which was the prep school, a classroom block in Oaklands Parade and more or less let me go with it, which I look back on an d thought, you know, I should have probably tried harder to get Greg Brookes to tie it in with the - - -
JM
00:56:55	The older range.
DM
00:56:57	The older buildings and I was criticised by that by a few of my friends in St Lucia, not architects.  However, the school council agreed with what I was doing and Mr Gargett came with me to any school council meetings, but, the reality is – when I look back – he let me go and in the end there was a bit of criticism and slight shrinkage in the floor, how do you open the windows, etc. etc.  So, he took me over there, he would always back me up, and to meet the council and explain why we’d done this. He was absolutely marvellous in getting over these difficulties that I had earlier found.  For instance, what do you say when the cost comes in more that your estimate, and he was just say, simply, this is the market value, we’ve gone to tender, if you try to alter it or go any further, we have kept economy strictly in mind when this is done, we recommend you proceed and they’d give way.  But, you know, earlier I’d had these terrible fights with people trying to vigorously reduce the cost.  So, that was a good lesson for me.
JM
00:58:24	Who were the chief designers in the firm at that time, who were doing the big high profile projects?
DM

00:58:30	Charlie – well the best designer I think they had would have been Elmas  who had been - - - 
JM
00:58:39	Kraams.  I don’t know that name
DM
00:58:42	Kraams he was Finnish I think.
JM
00:58:45	How did he spell it, do you remember?
DM
00:58:46	No.  K-h-a-r-m-s, might have been Kraams.    E-l-m-a-s I think it was, Elmas I think it was, Elmas Kraams.  He and Charlie Hamilton designed the PA Hospital after the war, when it was being built under day labour and I greatly admired what they’d done there.  Then Prince Charles Hospital, the designer there, but I honestly don’t know who actually did the big designs because, St John’s College – at St Lucia – is very well designed.  You can’t tell who signed it, who did the design.  I’m getting back to what Mr Gargett said, “It’s not I it’s we” and I don’t even know who designed that masterpiece at Churchie, which was the Magnus Block there, I think it was Bren Gargett, but, because it’s in his style, I know very well he did the – what used to be called the library – at Somerville House, and - - -
JM
01:00:05	It’s a fine building.
DM
01:00:07	He was proud of that but I didn’t think that was my, what I wanted to do.  He, I understood, that it was fine.  But, it was not what I wanted to do and that was all, and he was letting me go and of course gradually - - -  You asked me who else in the office, well, I mentioned Charlie Hamilton and another fellow is Vivian Curtis who had a marvellous concept of getting out of any architectural problem.  He was an old man then, although he looked older than he really was, he had some difficulty with – he had palsy in his hand or something like that – I forget – but the reality was that if you were in any serious trouble you went to him.  He’d go like this, his head would go down – you’d think he was asleep – for two minutes, it would come up and Mrs Denning, his secretary, would be there ready to shorthand it – he would write a letter without a mistake straight off like that.  She’d type it up and you couldn’t better for getting out of trouble.  
01:01:36	So, you know, that’s another aspect of architecture, he did design some dormitory buildings behind the brewery in Milton, in what was then the [01:01:47]
JM
01:01:49	That building’s for the seminary there, St Francis College?
DM
01:01:53	Yes.
JM
01:01:55	Okay, so they’re Conrad Gargett and by - - -
DM
01:01:57	By Vivian Curtis, which took me a lot of effort to find out who’d done some of these buildings.  Not even sure, because that was not the policy of the firm.  But, because he let me go on building, I almost had autonomous control over the jobs that I was doing.  Mind you, I suppose I was 24 – 25 by this time and they were paying me as much as I thought I was worth, and so – I’m not answering your question.  Mr Conrad – always Mr Conrad – that’s Bill and Peter, their sons, were mates of mine and had been, through the course, a bit above me but I’m talking about my golden years when I joined and I was under these fellow who my father described as very sound and Mr Conrad had had a heart attack and ostensibly wasn’t required to do any more work, but he used to come in – pretty well every day – and when he was well into his 80s, he, on his own, did the drawings for the revamp of the organ in the cathedral, including all the drawings of the carving that Lumpson – the wood carver – was to do.  And, they were absolutely stunning those drawings.  
01:03:34	But he, I always thought, was the engineer in the firm.  He and R J McWilliam – that’s Russell John McWilliam, one of our lecturers in structural engineering in the course – they were great mates and Arnold Conrad was a pioneer in reinforced concrete.  Old Mr Atkinson held him back in the early days, I only heard this later, in that it was Mr Atkinson’s firm and then he imported a Scottish partner, Charles McClay, who was extremely well talented too, but it wasn’t until Charles McClay was killed in a road accident really at the Greenslopes – Coorparoo level crossing with a train, he died and then the work got too much for Mr Atkinson.  By this time, Mr Conrad had left and gone out on his own, designed Scotts College in Warwick and a couple of picture theatres in Warwick, maybe Toowoomba, and then Mr Atkinson wrote to him and said will you come back, I’ll make you a partner.  So, he came back about 1918.  But, Mr Gargett had been working since a boy of 15 there and he was employed to print the specifications and the plans in the sunlight, but he just loved drawing.  They both worked very hard.  And, you’ve asked me again.

JM
01:05:29	Just thinking about which were the real milestone projects that you thought took the firm along.  You mentioned the hospital work before you’d come.  Obviously a big break for the firm it was very high technical specification and large buildings there in a modern style.
DM
01:05:43	And they continued really.  The hospital building, we were board architects, board representatives – architect, always attended a meeting of the board every month and eventually of course, us young Turks were taken along to face the board.  You’re going to ask me next what were the buildings built when I was there.
JM
01:06:06	I was going to ask you who the other young Turks were, who were they?  Who were the young Turks in the firm?
DM
01:06:11	Well, there were plenty of them.  Gary Cumming, Kerry Whiteoak, much livelier than I was.  And, later – but, I’m getting away from 1975 now.  I don’t want to do that if you don’t want me to.
JM
01:06:36	We’re interested in whatever you thinks’ relevant.  
DM
01:06:39	You can always edit out what I say.
JM
01:06:40	Yeah, our period is really through to ’75, so yeah.
DM

01:06:43	I don’t want to talk too long, I know your times limited and I’ve hardly got through it have I?
JM
01:06:47	We can always come back.
DM
01:06:49	That’s all right, that’s fine.
JM
01:06:52	But, what have we got on the list here Janina?
JG
01:06:57	A list of questions or a list of buildings?
JM
01:06:59	A list of buildings I think of it.
JG
01:07:02	SGIO building in 1971.  The library at St Hilda’s School in Southport, but these were only the ones that had a date because there were many more buildings if you want to - - - 
DM
01:07:10	Look at what I’ve got.
JM
01:07:12	Okay, what have you got there?
DM
01:07:13	I’ve got this.
JM
01:07:16	Spreadsheets?
DM
01:07:18	Hundreds of them, and, I by that time was involved with schools and I spent 20 years in the firm doing the independent secondary schools.  So, that was a very substantial portion of my life and I got very involved with that.  Until I got to the stage where I used to say, “I’m in danger of becoming a typecast actor here.”  And then I got into hospitals.  I loved the country hospitals and 1975, I only realised because I built that extension there in ’75.  The Boonah hospital was one I’d done at the same time and I was very proud of that and I went back, subsequently, and they patted me on the back and that’s always gratifying.  But, yes, that’s all the employees and I’ve been through all that.
JM
01:08:28	Have you got copies of that?
JG
01:08:29	No, we should - - -
DM
01:08:33	And, I commented on all of them.   Fred Lafferty for instance, very fine - - -
JG
01:08:41	And what is the colour coding?
DM
01:08:43	The colour coding, they’re the ones who are – no associate, secretary, troops.  And this, I got this by Angela Huddlestone, out of the firm, must have been a year or so ago.  July, 2008 – oh no, it was after that.  And, I just put lines against people I had associated with, or been friendly with - - -
JM
01:09:17	Very useful.
DM
01:09:23	I see my name there, there’s my son, he was working there.  Beautiful girls, secretary – oh, quick – Ian Monroe sticks out, yeah, Les Knight – he was talented.  He was an escapee from Hungary – Hungarian uprising.  He and his wife escaped the communist by the skin of their teeth.  He went and worked for the Snowy Mountains Authority, ended up as being the architect for the Gold Coast City Council, but he was with us and on my team at one.  I call about  my team, really, I do appreciate that – that I can say that, because I went from being a boy in the firm to being allowed to have a team of my own and I could pick who I wanted virtually and they were extremely talented people.  Peter Wilkes for instance, who now is in England – he and his wife were interested in computers in the early day.  He got so skilled in that, he gave up architecture – to my disgust, but recently I picked up a real estate brochure and it said there was a person – investor in England wanted a house in Indooroopilly with a northern aspect.  And, I thought, “That’s Peter Wilkes.”  He might be coming back.  He was a great mate of mine and another young fellow in the firm who was a tear away was Adrian Lanning, tearaway – that’s a wrong way – he was a very serious lad but by the time he was 21 he’d discovered girls and I thought I’d lost him and he got discontented.  He, I see by the telephone book, now lives at Karragarra Island, down in the bay, and I haven’t spoken to him for years and I think, one day we’ll go there for a Thursday walk and I’ll try and meet up with him again.  Unfortunately, he and Sue parted company, but Sue was one of these girls he got terribly fond of, but anyhow they had two beautiful boys.
JM
01:12:04	These people were on the schools team or this was later with the hospitals.
DM
01:12:07	Yes, all.
JM
01:12:10	All the way through.  So, which were the schools that you were working on?
DM
01:12:14	St Paul’s School, the Southport School.  St Hilda’s School, Somerville House, Church of England Grammar School, Brisbane Boys College and I’m going to leave somebody out – Villanova, Blackheath in Charters Towers, we did a job there.  But, they were not as continuous clients for me as these Anglican schools and then after the Anglican schools I got into Anglican aged care and I got a great friend in the Church.  See, Mr Gargett always insisted we do it with one person in the diocese in council and it was the registrar.  We weren’t to take orders from any head mistress, head master.  It had to be the registrar back then – well that doesn’t happen now.  I did work on the Cathedral as well, St John’s to a degree, but - - -
JM
01:13:35	So, with the school’s buildings do you think – I mean, there’s obviously a complicated social and functional arrangements of a school, but did you think there were particular architectural issues that came out of school design, in terms of the courtyard structures in the older schools, or?
DM
01:13:54	Would you believe on the front page of this morning’s paper I was reminded of this, because there was a picture of a new groundsman they’ve got at Churchie and in the background are buildings that I didn’t know, but I realise that there was an influence I had had on it.  There was the big ruse and I know that the architects who came after me, in other firms, have picked up on these.
JM
01:14:26	The dominant roof form idea?
DM
01:14:27	Yeah, dominant room form at the Southport School.
JM
01:14:31	And the collegiate structure of the older schools, like Churchie and so on have got a courtyard, college like structure.  Did you – obviously you worked with that at Churchie –  did you find it useful in other places?
DM
01:14:45	Yes, Helen Granowski  was the head mistress at St Hilda’s School and she saw things the way I did and although the instructions were, you don’t take instructions – from Mr Gargett this was, this was the early days – by this time head mistresses and head masters had much more of a pull and they had their say and although it was under the registrar within Church House, what they said was – went.  So, yes, I was not conscious particularly at Churchie, for instance, of continuing the courtyard theme.  To me that didn’t fit what the head masters wanted.  But, at St Hilda’s School that fitted in precisely with Helen Granowski, the head mistress there.
JM
01:15:49	Did you look at the time at what Langer was doing at St Peters?
DM
01:15:53	No.  Eric Paris had taken over that work.  I didn’t – I was not conscious of the work that Karl had done there.  Although, I was conscious that he’d done the chapel there and he done - - -
JM
01:16:10	He did mainly the chapel, he had ideas about, you know, how the buildings would be arranged to make spaces on the campus.
DM
01:16:17	That was a strong point in town planning that we were taught by him, but my associations with Karl, as I said earlier, were minimal.  So, anyhow I was looking up this to see where the jobs were and I have to say that this is not terribly useful, without me being beside you because, although it’s not complete, it doesn’t go back beyond a certain date – here’s the jobs list.  
JM
01:17:05	That’s the jobs list?

DM
01:17:06	Yeah.  What, and she was a very respected secretary, said, “On closer inspection of the staff list it appears that we are missing a fair few decades of names with no chance of finding them, as you may know, was not long before computerisation and never having found any records of the type in archives, don’t know  how useful it’s going to be to you.”  Well, indeed this was enormous use to me.  See, Joe orange was another architect, but he wouldn’t have – the Lord will strike me down if I say he wasn’t a notable designer – but that wasn’t his strong point.  His strong point was looking after the jobs.  Making sure they were on time and on cost.  Ted [Weebley 01:18:12], I inherited his desk, he was just an architect.  He was an elderly fellow, very conscientious, I inherited the Boonah Hospital from him and then was able to go ahead and actually build the hospital, after years of political – how shall I say – dilatoriness.  The Glennie School, see I wasn’t involved there at all.  Ipswich Hospital, I was involved in a problem there.
JM
01:18:53	So, the ones that you’ve marked up here, with the pencil, with names or an arrow, they’re ones that you had some involvement with?
DM
01:19:02	Well, they’re just me trying to - - -
JM
01:19:05	Recall who was involved there.
DM
01:19:07	See, there’s Elmas Kraams K-r-a-a-m-s, I’ve spelt it and I think that probably could be right. E-l-m-a-s  K-r-a-a-m-s.  So, Keith Frost.  Keith died too young.
JM
01:19:26	He had a reputation as a great designer.
DM
01:19:30	Yeah.
JM
01:19:31	Was he the guys who did the fire stations?
DM
01:19:34	Yes. And, he did the Women’s College, which the ladies there obviously have enriched enormously. And, because of  this I believe they appreciated the architecture which he had done, as I appreciated it.  But, in the firm he was a forbidding person.  No one wanted to work with him because he was ‘old grumbles’ they used to call him, but I shouldn’t say that, he’s gone.
JM
01:20:08	If he’s gone he can’t complain.
DM
01:20:12	Sorry, Keith.  So, you know, what I’m trying to emphasise, it was a team divided into groups.
JM
01:20:24	Who worked on St Thomas’ at Toowong?
DM
01:20:26	Me.
JM
01:20:27	Ah right.  Repairs, I see yes.
DM
01:20:29	I fixed up the glass windows.  My parents were married there.
JM
01:20:35	Mine too.
DM
01:20:36	Oh were they?
JM
01:20:37	I was baptised there.
DM
01:20:39	So, you’re a local guy.
JM
01:20:40	Oh yes.
DM
01:20:42	So, which suburb were you living in?
JM
01:20:47	I grew up in rural New South Wales, but my father’s family lived in Toowong.
DM
01:20:51	Oh, did they?
JM
01:20:52	Yeah, up in Booth Street, you know, just above Birrell’s Library there.
DM
01:21:02	So, yeah, well there they all are and as I say they’re of limited – Magnus Block, third extension see.  Some of them were minor jobs.
JM
01:21:20	Would you mind if we took some of these things and photocopied them and brought it back to you?
DM
01:21:24	I’m a bit concerned that without my explanation, you could make – you wouldn’t know why that was done, because there’s a story behind everyone.  So, I would prefer – without Conrad and Gargett’s permission – to let it out because – but, I’m only too happy to help you in anything you want here.  But, as you can see, being nearly 53 years since I graduated, there’s a tremendous amount of information I stored up.  And, you asked me before about the work I – there were jobs I really enjoyed doing because people were so helpful.  There were jobs I didn’t enjoy because of trouble with the builder, the builder was going broke, but, I had one job where the builder went broke on me and I was able to salvage it without even missing a step and to me that was a thing I greatly valued.  The building – it was in Hervey Bay, Point Vernon – aged care facility, but it cost the owner, shall we call it, nothing, because I was able to keep going with the support of the employees of the builder.  The builder just abandoned the job.  I had to call the police to stop theft on the job of course.  But, see there were little incidents throughout my life like that.
JM
01:23:27	Your house here is very fine.  It’s great to see it in so original condition.  It’s great to see an architect’s house.  Did you do many single houses?
DM
01:23:37	Oh yes.  Quite a few.  Not as many as Bob Froud, he told me he’d one 300 and I believe that, that’s right.
JM
01:23:47	Are then any that you particularly recall?  One that got in the Conrad Gargett book which is the Carter residence in Kenmore.
DM
01:24:00	Yeah, you can overlook that from the street.  Yes.  Well, it’s just like saying – my daughter, oh she’s a lovely daughter – but my son, no I don’t like him as much.  But I do.  So, that is very difficult for me.  This house has provided, just between you and I, a continuing joy for me and I can’t explain it because there were many experiments in this house.  For instance, that wall, all the walls are hardboard, they’re quarter inch hardboard.  In the early days at Conrad and Gargett and I was doing that dormitory which accompanied the class room block I’d done earlier at Churchie, the builder rang me up and said, look, this is not working this partition between the beds, it wobbles too much.  So, I shot over there and I said, you’ve used the wrong method here.  You don’t use this elastic adhesive, you’ve got to wet the sheets and you use this aquadhere on the sheet and then quickly nail it up before it dries.  That was the first time I’d used that, and suddenly – I came back three days later – there’s absolutely no criticism from the builder because suddenly all those partitions had gone solid.  And he was astonished.
01:25:42	So, I started to use that structurally.  There was a job at the Southport School for a house there I had to do for the – one of the school chaplains.  The chaplain’s residence it was.  I was very young at this time and I designed a house with cantilevers on it from circular concrete columns underneath.  Now, the builder had used blackbutt as the framing timber and it was as green as grass.  It had come from New South Wales where these trees grow like weeds and because he’d used it green, it had no stiffness and here the cantilever was sagging horribly.  Well, I mentioned it to Mr Conrad.  He went into a panic about it and he said, “You just put steel columns under.”  There was no way I wanted to do that because it would ruin my ideal of what this house was.  So, I thought and I thought and I thought I wonder if I use this system inside – it was hardboard you couldn’t get plasterboard, it was too expensive, fibrous plaster – so I changed the spec in the job for the builder and used the dividing walls as supporting the cantilevers.  And, I got the builder to prop it all up beyond the horizontal and I prayed hard.  Six week later when the whole building was finished, the props were taken away, I hope it’s still like that, but I knew that it was quite okay.
JM
01:27:40	All came back true?
DM
01:27:42	It didn’t even drop a bit and subsequently in any buildings I used this principal.  Including the whole of this house.  I didn’t have enough partition walls to brace the house because I wanted the house to be able to be easily altered later.  As it happened the house is 44 years old and I haven’t altered it at all yet.  Not even the paint colour.  But, the idea being it was going to be minimal cost to build and that was just this rectangle, because I wanted to get the government subsidy for it if I could keep the price below, I think it was $10,000 for the whole house.  So, there were no carpets on the floors, no cupboards, just prop up the sink.  Prop up the basin, put the toilets in and I’d finish with the builder.  And, then, I got my subsidy, so then I – my grandmother left me a bequest – I was able to afford the cupboards, which are these. 
01:28:57	There was another adventure involved, I didn’t know what to specify the timber, but way back in the Job and Froud days the builder asked me – and I’d done a Church at Oxley – if he could use this scrubbed timber – rose mahogany – in the Church, as a feature wall.  I said, “oh” so I went into it and I thought oh yes, that looks all right.  Would you do it for the same price as pine?  He said, “Oh yeah, that’s all right,” he said. Well, when the job was finished, I opened the door to do a final inspection and was overwhelmed by the smell of roses in the Church and it was this wall.
JM
01:29:36	Beautiful timber.
DM
01:29:35	There’s the timber left completely untreated.  The whole of the floor here, untreated, because this house too smelt of roses for three weeks and then faintly for a couple of years, whenever we were away.  So, I’d used the same tactics here.  It was much at the same time I think.
JM
01:30:01	I think we’re close to running out of time, we might have to come back and tap you again.
DM
01:30:05	That’s all right, yeah.
JM
01:30:06	Looking back, of the architects we’ve spoken to, you’re one who’s perhaps got the longest memory having had this childhood experience of the older generation of architects before the war and long experience in hour own career.  Do you think that there’s some continuing kind of threads or ideas or ethos in architecture in Queensland?
DM
01:30:29	To me, the greatest worry is that they seem to build these days without an architectural philosophy.  Without a driving under – well, some gut feeling that the architect has, why he has done this.  There’s a lot of tending to see what the famous architects had done and copy them.  That was something that Prof and Vida Lahey were very strong on, that we didn’t do.  Even though Elizabeth did say I copied her painting and I can’t say either way.  But, that’s – and I’m old fashioned  I know – but, indeed Bruce Wolfe, when I retired and that he was now head of Conrad and Gargett, he said, “Now Duncan, we don’t want you to do any architecture here, we just want you to do these jobs for those four years,” and I was quite content to do that.
01:31:38	I wasn’t going to interfere with their architecture at all, but, I did spot a flaw in a drawing one day and I went up to the fellow, who’s a very good architect, I said, “Look, I’m a bit worried about that copper, that huge length of copper you’ve got there, I think it’s going to expand and break in the future.” And he said, “Thanks” and he changed the detail.  But, I used to pride myself, because of my problems I’d had in all these experiments, that I used to say I was the pathological architect.  I was employed to search out the pathology of why buildings were failing and I had to find the answer and that little incident about the stressed skin construction was just one of those early on.  So, I enjoyed that challenge after years, whether they do that or are taught that today I don’t know.  Do they John?
JM
01:32:59	I think, yeah, I think that you’re right that the division of labour in the way that buildings are procured means architects – their responsibility is narrowed and their expertise is narrowed with it and I think that that sort of wholistic understanding of the conception of the building through the construction is something that probably, we’re less strong on than people of your generation.
DM
01:33:21	And, indeed I saw that as a problem because that’s inculcated in the – that I ended up realising that what we charged, a modest seven and a half percent, was in subsequent years, been taken over by project managers that got as much as fifteen percent, which was ridiculous.  We used to do it for free.  That was how I saw it.  I did a lot of my own structures too.  Although, I had very good friends in structural engineering and of course, Mr Gargett didn’t like me doing these, sometimes – well, the illustration of the sagging cantilevers on the chaplain’s residence, he didn’t like us doing the structure, but he let me in those early days.
JM
01:34:19	Well that’s great Duncan, we might leave it there, but it would be great to take a photograph of you with the house to go with the file.
DM

01:34:25	I’m fine, okay.
JM
01:34:27	That’s okay.  And I’m sure we’ll be back to - - -
DM
01:34:29	I’m sorry I dominated the conversation.
JM
01:34:32	No, no, that’s the point.
