Before moving into questions  relating to your formal architectural education, I thought it would be useful to start this interview with a question on your family history, and how that has informed your conception of architectural practice within Queensland and your decision to become an architect."

He went to London and whatever the process was, he got an ARIBA there, I don?t know whether it?s by exam or what and he returned to Brisbane commenced practice in 1884."

But, he certainly picked up the British membership while he was there.  So, he commenced practice, 1884, and during his career he was the President of the Queensland Institute of Architects on about three occasions, the last being about 1921 after probably a decade or more of other things."

            "transcript": "I suspect it may have been or he may have seen it as a help for architecture.  In fact I think that might have been his view.  But, anyway, he was a successful  student and he won the first Walter and Eliza for Travelling Fellowship which was just ear the outbreak of the first world war and it took him to America and then on to Britain and he was in Britain during the war, working for munitions, returned to Australia about 1920 ? 1921 and joined his father in partnership."

I fact, all our training was at George Street."

We?re actually really interested in talking a bit about that.  You entered at 1949 and you said you did it at George Street in town.  So, that was still connected then to the central tech part of that program?"

The university degree course, which I was a member, and the technical college course ? the diploma in architecture ? which was on the same campus, just different buildings and it was run ? ours was full time study, the first three years, the diploma course was part time study and at fourth year we joined together and we did the last three years together, the difference being that we had to write thesis and diploma students didn?t."

Then we came together in fourth year and we studied together, at part time at night ? I think it was three nights a week ? and the only difference was that we were required to do a thesis at the end of that time, they weren?t.  But, we still maintained a stronger social link with Professor Cummings and Bruce Lucas, than the diploma students, they were, sort of, lesser people."

We did architectural subjects.  Architectural Principles one, two, three and then in the fourth year we joined with these diploma students, a much bigger class, as I said before we felt quite inadequate compared to them in terms of practice experience."
